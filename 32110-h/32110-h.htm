<h2>ARGUMENT OF THE POEM.</h2>


<p>From the moment of my earliest acquaintance with Colonial
History, I have felt all the pressure of a task laid upon
me, tightening its grasp as I reached maturer years;
that of an attempt to rescue the Aztecs from their letterless
and mythical position in history, to the position which
their possibilities at least argue for them; and this feeling
has been far less the outgrowth of the enthusiasm awakened
for the Aztecs, as the indignation felt at the whole
conduct of the Spanish Conquest.</p>

<p>Realizing the gravity of the task, I have been led to
carefully weigh and investigate the different theories advanced
as to the origin of the Aztecs, and to adopt the
argument of the poem as the best ground on which to
unite the Sun Worship of the East with the Mythology of
of the West.</p>

<p>Reverently, and with a full realization of how great
must ever be the distance between the actual work and
the ideal of my early inspiration, I lay the gathered chaplet
at the shrine of old Chapultepec, and only regret that
the fruiting should have fallen so far short of the promise
of its blooming.</p>

<p>To Hubert Howe Bancroft the living, and W. H. Prescott<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the dead, differing as they do in some very material
respects, yet essentially the same in spirit, I wish to record
my indebtedness for their admirable and exhaustive
works that have induced to a final effort the poem of
which this is prefatory.</p>

<p>Some years since, I found in an abridged history of
the United States, a brief outline that led me back to the
Dispersal at Shinar (certainly a safe location for a speculative
beginning) for the origin of the Aztec race.</p>

<p>It occurs to me now, with a shade of the ludicrous,
that if safety were the all-important thing in the premises,
I might have gone back a step farther to the figs and
pomegranites of Eden, and prayed for the shade of Adam
to cover the exotic which I have humbly tried to rescue
from what seems to me to be an <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'underserved'">undeserved</ins>  obscurity.
The careful analogies drawn between Egypt and
the Aztecs by both Prescott and Bancroft could be better
met by locating the origin at Shinar than at any other
point, as it takes us back to a date where we may consistently
locate the Shepherd Kings and the overrunning
of Mizraim by them, a part of Egypt's early history which
is outlined (more or less briefly) by nearly all early <ins title="Transcriber's Note: period added">historians.</ins> </p>

<p>As to the initial period of Sun Worship and its origin,
I could of necessity have but little aid, and if I have
seemed a little too speculative, I have only this apology:
The prodigy of Egypt's prehistoric development, and the
manufacture of glass, antedating historic research. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
needs no great imaginative tension to crown some incipient
philosopher not only with the discovery of glass,
but, that in its proper shape, it could be made to concentrate
the solar rays, and produce fire; and at that day and
age, what possible superstitions might result from these
discoveries!</p>

<p>After the re-establishment of the Mizraim descent, and
the consequent expulsion of the "Sons of Lud," the line
of their journey is the natural outgrowth of their religious
fanaticism. They know that India and the far East
are inhabited, and they seek the uninhabited track for
their exit.</p>

<p>The Mound Builders seem to be historic cousins of the
Aztecs, certainly the superiors of the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aborgines'">aborigines</ins>  of the
North and Middle Atlantic.</p>

<p>The expulsion of the Mound Builders will admit of
many theories, and I have simply adopted the one that
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'occured'">occurred</ins>  to me as consistent with the Christian inspiration
of all great events.</p>

<p>The settlement of Mexico by the Aztecs, (as a branch
of the Mound Builders) follows naturally in the wake of
previous events, and the chain is thus made complete,
with no serious hazard to its consistency as merely speculative
drama, leading up to what is plainly historical.</p>

<p>I have striven to be historically consistent, following
the letter of events closely, taking conjectural ground in
but few instances.</p>

<p>If I have seemed to be censorious, even to rancor at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
times, I have only given vent to the repressed indignation
of Prescott and other authors on the subject of the
Spanish Conquest.</p>

<p>The only possible justification for the excesses of Cortez
and his adherents, is the age in which the Conquest
took place; and those who seek to justify it in this way,
point to the opening of the present century, and to Napoleon,
decoying the imbecile king and the weak Asturias
into abdication and banishment to make room for his
brother Joseph. This is a plague-mark upon the present
century, and though a plain case of retributive justice
through the visiting of the sins of the fathers upon the
children, still the fact remains that the attempt to bring
<i>right</i> of any multiple of wrongs, must always record a
failure.</p>

<p>A sufficient answer to the latitude of the age, is the
fact that a corresponding age gave us Plymouth, and not
long after Penn's colony; nor can the Spaniards claim
the same justification for excesses as these coincident colonists,
all of whom had felt the lash of religious intolerance.
The Spanish Conquest, antedating the divisions
that followed the reformation, has no such covert for their
lustful excrescences.</p>

<p>Any system of religious ethics that severs human responsibility
from the domain of conscience, and furnishes a
market for the indulgences that cover all the excesses of
the body politic, cannot be expected to bring forth the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
best of fruit from a bloom so blighted by human lust,
and so blackened by human selfishness.</p>

<p>If, amid all of their <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'intolerence'">intolerance</ins>  and deceit, they had
respected the homely records and the grotesque landmarks
of the nation they destroyed, the cavaliers might
have shown them as a slight <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'palliation,and'">palliation, and</ins>  at once furnished
the historian the shadow of justification for their abuses;
but the mental caste that could adopt any, and every device
of deception and treachery to accomplish its ends,
threw itself at once into the arms of a priestcraft, if possible
more implacable than themselves; and obedient to
their demands, tore down their landmarks, and ground
their records to powder.</p>

<p>Surely, there is no fanaticism like religious fanaticism,
and no licentiousness like that of the unbridled devotee
of the Church.</p>

<p>Finally, as a whole, I feel confident that my effort will
not fail to create food for thought, and eventually justify
the effort which called it forth. To a nature partially
Huguenot in its origin, and more so in sympathy and inclination,
I have tried to add the temperate element
that would impart freedom from undue prejudice and
passion; but as the work is of necessity vindicatory on the
one hand, and repressive on the other, I have been compelled
to use good, plain Saxon words in the closing pages,
justified only by the verity of their signification.</p>

<p>The body of the work is given in decimeters, varying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
in only a few cases where the expression seemed to require
a different form.</p>

<p>I would rather not close these already extended remarks
without recording my testimony, with that of others,
of the positive pleasure experienced both in the progress
and completion of a work of this character; and if I shall
have been as fortunate in securing and retaining an auditory,
I shall be twice blessed; for our highest ambition
should ever be that of contributing to the happiness of
others.</p>

<p>The reward of earnest labor, conscientiously performed,
is the prize only <i>once</i> exceeded in the economy
of things, and that <i>once</i> beyond the ken of our divulgence;
yet, may we not hope that there is no actual
severance between the earthly type and the heavenly reality,
that the crown honestly won, and the prize worthily
gained on earth, may both, retaining their semblance, the
more perfectly glow in the clearer atmosphere of heaven.</p>

<div class='title'>THE DISPERSAL AT SHINAR.</div>

<div class='poem2'>
As mariner upon the rocky sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a compass, helm, or heavenly hope,</span><br />
A part of Earth's great ancestry to be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the plains of Shinar; and they grope</span><br />
In nature's darkness; they have lost the way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That leadeth to the Father, and can find</span><br />
No clue of that great Presence, once their stay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And still as near; but sin doth make us blind,</span><br />
And when it fastens on the soul, the Father fades away.<br />
<br />
How wholly lost, when man cannot descry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One token of his Maker in the soul&mdash;</span><br />
One step remains, the animal must die;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But death has superseded its control,</span><br />
Since the immortal "Ego" is no more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The spirit gone from its companion, dust&mdash;</span><br />
The ashes are but animate in vain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When love, and light, have given place to lust</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>And conscience gives no puncture for its pain.<br />
<br />
Thus were they gathered, in this day far gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So near the causeway of the almighty past,</span><br />
That retrospect brings close, the thought of God&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We wonder that a cloud could overcast,</span><br />
So primitive a people, that the Shepherd's voice<br />
Should leave no lingering echo, for the ear, so tokened and so choice.<br />
<br />
And they would build a city, and a tower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose top would reach the very verge of Heaven;&mdash;</span><br />
The puniest arm, is puissent in power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When to its grasp supernal aid is given;</span><br />
But muscles may, like cordage, swell the arm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And arteries, like rills of mountains flow.</span><br />
Weak is the blood that breakers them to harm,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fires of passion but a moment glow.</span><br />
<br />
They, as the infants play upon the rim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of ancient Ocean, had been rocked to sleep</span><br />
In the bare arms of Nature; she would trim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her lamps for them, and patient vigil keep</span><br />
Upon their slumbers; and Heaven, to them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was but a brilliant, close-spread canopy,</span><br />
Or crystal dome, a sort of diadem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just out of easy reach, and they could see</span><br />
No reason why they might not build a tower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would intercept it; and their foolish pride</span><br />
Supposed this little caprice of the hour,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through all the after age, would witness of their power.</span><br />
<br />
They made them bricks, and steadily they reared<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The spiral column heavenward; the Great Eye</span><br />
Bent vigilantly on them, as they neared<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The upper ether, silent as the sky</span><br />
Draws round its garniture; into each soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crept the first rootlets of an unknown tongue;</span><br />
Each household head placed under his control<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The elements of intercourse, first flung</span><br />
Together by the great Teacher; just before<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they had dropped from their exulting hands</span><br />
The rough-made tools; they closed forevermore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their mutual labor, though in other lands</span><br />
They could resume their use, this was the last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the poor monument that they had reared&mdash;</span><br />
The workmen stand in wonderment aghast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though they had wrought together, and had cheered</span><br />
Each other in their task, each quivering lip<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathed but confusion to the other's ears,</span><br />
No more from common cup of thought they sip,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But forced to strangerhood for many, many years.</span><br />
<br />
In what a school was fashioned our first thought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How the poor soul is dumbed, and quivering,</span><br />
When we conceive what the Great Master wrought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How are we littled, what a nameless thing</span><br />
"Is man, that thou art mindful" thus "of him."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou settest up, and pullest down, and we&mdash;</span><br />
Our hearts are hushed, our vision is made dim&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Mites in the balance of imponderate destiny.<br />
<br />
A camp in Central India, 'neath the palms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And where the lap of nature is so full,</span><br />
That all the world may beggar it of alms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drink of its repletion; a mere tool</span><br />
Of hungry Kingdoms, thirsty Dynasties&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The finger-tips of Alexander's arm&mdash;</span><br />
The plethorite of the Augustan age&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gilt that margins all the tapestries</span><br />
Down through middle ages; and the charm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That lends a mellow fragrance to the page</span><br />
Of her, the Island Queen, whose arm meets arm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the embrace of earth, her borders refuge from avenging harm.</span><br />
<br />
A journey into Egypt, with their flocks before,<br />
And peaceful conquests back, an opening door<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To vast historic truths, a Niobe</span><br />
Moaning her children's travail in advance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A restless nomad people, like the sea,</span><br />
Stirred by involuntary force, whose billows dance<br />
To music of the spheres, stern Autocrat, and yet a slave to its own mastery.<br />
</div>


<div class='title'>SOJOURN IN EGYPT.</div>

<div class='poem3'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Egypt! how shall we approach thy face?</span><br />
How steal from thy dumb lips one scrap of song?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou stand'st alone, and sendest from thy place</span><br />
One word, that human lips have shaped for thee,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>To seal thy mighty arch with "mystery."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Time calls his children 'round him, and they each</span><br />
Give answer to their names; gray Troy and Greece<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pour out the lesson their dumb lips would teach,</span><br />
Carthage, Ph&oelig;nicia, Parthia and Rome<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clothe death with all the eloquence of speech;</span><br />
And each form linklets of an unbroke chain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But they are youthful; in perspective dim</span><br />
As if unmoved with either joy or pain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With arms enfolded, and with eye all fixed,</span><br />
A silent portal in the track of time.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the rough surge of nations still unmixed,</span><br />
Where the great fathers left thee in the Sphinx,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And heaped the sands upon thy broken links,</span><br />
Thou dost look down the ages to defy<br />
Tradition, inspiration, and all future progeny.<br />
<br />
She sleeps as they advance; their lowing kine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And noisy herds before them, and with the flute</span><br />
And siren song, they win, as with old wine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their way into the slumbering and the mute</span><br />
Endormir of old Nile; but Egypt wakes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And breast to breast, opposes their advance.</span><br />
In vain against the shepherd crew, she breaks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her ill-spent arrows, shattered every lance,</span><br />
And Mizraim's sons the rod of empire yield<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To sons of Lud; they spread their many tents</span><br />
On Nile's unequaled garniture of field,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The one discordant note in her great eloquence.</span><br />
<br />
How Nature heals what man has thus laid waste,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stoic songsters of the worlds orchaste</span><br />
Sing the same song, for friend and foe alike,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They lift no arm upon a world defaced</span><br />
With war's stern tread, but with one voice they strike<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The note of conquest or the requiem</span><br />
Of some o'ertoppled Realm, Nature moves on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To shame the bugle blare, or sound of drum,</span><br />
And sets her thousand nestlings in the dust of the unnumbered nations that are gone.<br />
<br />
One after one, in stately march of time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kings pass, like common people, to the dust;</span><br />
Unless by over-reaching, and the crime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of too much selfhood, they are rudely thrust</span><br />
A little sooner to their Maker's hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And their succession made accelerate</span><br />
By that potention, which each scepter mans,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fix each calendar, with human date.</span><br />
No mortal is a law unto himself,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And much less, he who holds the reins of power;</span><br />
For wisdom seldom is concentrated so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That one weak soul is master of the hour,</span><br />
Unquestioned arbiter of human fate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Free to subdue, to persecute, to kill</span><br />
The soul that reaches this enlarged estate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meets with a giant in the human will,</span><br />
That soon or late, will crush him with its skill.<br />

<div class='title'>SUN WORSHIP.</div>

<div class='poem2'>
Dread Guard! whose portal is another world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy mandate never can be circumscribed;</span><br />
Only that Hand thy car to being whirled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And set thy lips, forevermore unbribed,</span><br />
Can break the seal of silence; we look out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And over both eternities, and waste</span><br />
Our energies, to find some well-tried route<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of life's labyrinth, where we may taste</span><br />
The true nepenthe that disarms all doubt.<br />
<br />
Beyond all human ken the key is kept;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our prison is too strong, and will not break,</span><br />
Our Keeper's eyes are those that never slept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet never slept for love and our dear sake;</span><br />
Touched by God's hand, the bolts will always yield;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We rule him; in our weakness, if we ask,</span><br />
Our asking turns the desert to a field,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shapes a coronal of every task.</span><br />
A pestilence has struck this favored land&mdash;<br />
Religion pleads in health; it now must take command.<br />
The gods of Egypt, all are impotent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The people beat the empty air in vain;</span><br />
No orgie gains the purchase of content,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their altars only mock the nation's pain.</span><br />
The King has called a council to discuss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The best-laid methods of religious thought.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Of counselors, there is an overplus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many are the schemes that they have brought,</span><br />
All conjured since they lost their way. The years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had slowly passed, since God himself had spoke,</span><br />
And hearts are human things, and their hot tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Melting their souls to harmony, in echoing murmur broke:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Soul! that is all song,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">O Heart! that is all love,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Right! that knows no wrong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Arm! that is all strong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Upon our bosoms move.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Eye! that is all sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">O Voice! that is all sound,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Life! that is all might,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Wing! that is all flight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Where, where can you be found?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Ear! that only hears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">O Voice! that only sings,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Eye! that knows no tears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Time! that counts no years,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Lend us thy gift of wings.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Faith! that wants no form,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">O Hope! all unafraid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Sun! without a storm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Summer! always warm,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 7em;">Where shall our hearts be stayed?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">O Spirit! infinite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">O thou unchanging Word!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Whose echoes round us flit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">With all the past enlit,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">O make thee to be heard!</span><br />
<br />
So sang the gathered choral of the King,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so, with saddened hearts, responded all</span><br />
The gathered multitude; with what a spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is set the chords of Nature; and the call</span><br />
From any searching soul a unit is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of universal and insatiate thirst.</span><br />
The longing story one may sing as his,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Responsive hearts all echo with the first,</span><br />
Which shows how deep are all of our desires;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How earnestly we peer out in the dark!</span><br />
How are we freighted, all, with latent fires!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How, on our souls and in our hearts, the Master leaves His mark!</span><br />
<br />
There rose, from on the outskirts of the crowd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One bowed with lengthened years, yet nobly bent</span><br />
With the more potent weight of earnest thought;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His massive brain and princely bearing lent</span><br />
A more than common strength to his clear eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As, on his shepherd's staff, his form was bent;</span><br />
Near to the King, with faltering step he came,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spake, as if a master spake, with all his soul aflame.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh King, and sons of Lud! No pardon asks<br />
Old Kohen for the words that leap his lips;<br />
No earthly throne gives warrant to my voice;<br />
But he, the God, of whom our fathers told,<br />
The God of Noah; he, at whose command<br />
The patriarch bent to labor; and till twice<br />
A hundred harvest moons had waned, wrought on<br />
The ark, and saved the seed of man to earth,<br />
He, he, has spoken! and his words have sunk<br />
So deeply in my heart I must be heard.&mdash;<br />
<br />
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original has a single quotation mark instead of a double">"Thus</ins>  saith the Lord: 'O truant sons of Lud,<br />
Why grope ye in the dark, why not return<br />
To the great Father's house? How have I called<br />
And waited for an answer to my suit!<br />
O sons of men, return! repent! believe!<br />
Where have ye wandered, that ye have not heard<br />
The voice of your Jehovah in the wind,<br />
And on the storm and tempest, when in wrath<br />
He thunders in the ears of men; repent!<br />
And on the desert in the hot simoom<br />
Writ fervent words to warn you of your way.<br />
<br />
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original has two single quotation marks here">"'I</ins>  am the God, of whom your fathers spake;<br />

Yet, on the threshold of your life I placed<br />
The ministry of love, and with my lips<br />
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original missing this word">I</ins>  kissed the clay to life. How have I longed<br />
To hold the race as I their fathers held,<br />
Encircled in the Everlasting Arms;<br />
But ye would not; ye are yourselves, a law,<br />
To your own beings in my image made,<br />
And ye must choose to live, to love, to learn.<br />
How great is my compassion, and how long<br />
I have kept watch, and waited for my lost!<br />
<br />
"'My very anger is the throne of love.&mdash;<br />
Because I could not lose the multitudes,<br />
The myriads of millions yet unborn,<br />
I spoke your father Noah into work,<br />
And set afloat the remnant of his loins,<br />
And oped the gates of Heaven to flood the earth.<br />
I saw the race go down to watery graves,<br />
In sorrow; and I saw a deeper wound<br />
Had I but spared; I struck the seedling off,<br />
Rather than smite the tree; I move in storms<br />
To purify; and in the tempest smite<br />
Only to save.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">I saw the impious hands</span><br />
Your fathers raised in Shinar, and I came<br />
And in the night, gave each another tongue,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>And scattered their device, and smote their lips<br />
That they raised not to mine. How could I see<br />
Their folly and not smite? I loved them so;<br />
Ye, who have children, look within your hearts,<br />
And in them see the miniatures of mine;<br />
More of the parent than your soul can feel.<br />
<br />
"'Behold in me the source and spring of love;<br />
I followed with paternal care to Ind,<br />
I saw, and I stood guard upon your steps;<br />
More than a father's love was in my soul,<br />
More than a mother's tenderness inurned.<br />
The mountains are the mole-hills of my strength;<br />
Yet am I weak in love; I would not send<br />
One single child to the eternal world<br />
All unprepared; but ye have gone astray;<br />
Ye are my flock, and I would turn you back<br />
Before the wolves shall fatten of your flesh.<br />
<br />
"'Bring offerings from your herds, the choicest bring,<br />
(Are they not also mine?) and altars build<br />
And offer them thereon, but further bring<br />
The contrite heart, and the unsullied hand,<br />
Bring, as your fathers told you, Abel brought,<br />
And I will meet you on the altar's brink,<br />
With fire from Heaven, and consume it all.<br />
Ask not again to look upon my face;<br />
Ye cannot look, and live; I only speak,<br />
As I now speak, through Kohen; he it is,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Out from among you I have set apart<br />
<br />
"'To be my sponsor; listen to my words:<br />
Build up your altars, offer from your best;<br />
Am I not better than the best you have?<br />
When ye have builded, pray; pour out your hearts<br />
As ye pour out the blood; prayer is the key<br />
To my most inner soul; the voice of love<br />
Is prayer. It is the angel's wing that fell<br />
Never yet short of Paradise. The voice<br />
That trembles on the lips of infancy,<br />
When reaching out to reason, and the last<br />
That passes with the shadow of the sun<br />
When life's last slope is reached, and never yet<br />
Has the repentant spirit left unalmsed.<br />
<br />
"'Have ye not heard how "Enoch walked with God,<br />
And he was not," because I drew him up?<br />
He kept so closely locked in my embrace,<br />
That there was nothing left of him to die.<br />
So would I have you walk, and learn the way;<br />
For I am very near each human soul,<br />
And ye may blend your being into mine,<br />
And, losing self, be only found of me.<br />
Ye all through Adam sinned; but there will come<br />
A time when, in the second Adam, will the first<br />
Transgression be atoned; your altars then<br />
May all be turned to ashes; for I send<br />
My best beloved, my ever blessed Son,<br />

Yet, he fell short, and I foresaw it all<br />

He cometh in the flesh! and ye shall see<br />

Oh! is it not enough? Can even I<br />
Do more? Your children shall behold my words<br />
Grown to fulfillment, and they all shall see<br />

<br />
He ceased; and there arose from out the crowd<br />
The murmuring voice of question on the air;<br />
Some thought him moved of God, and long and loud<br />
Gave acclamation in his favor; "Where,"<br />
Cried they, "can such authority be found?<br />
Whence come those gracious words, if not from God?&mdash;<br />
Power, wisdom, love, entripled in the sound<br />
A mother's tenderness, a father's rod."<br />
<br />
Then spake the unctious King; and through the King,<br />
The man; for he was but a tattered rag<br />
Of royalty: "What is this wondrous thing,<br />
Old Kohen, you propose? Make haste, let lag<br />
Your purpose; why is it, we cannot speak<br />
Face unto face with your great Deity?&mdash;<br />
Our fathers say old Noah did&mdash;what leak<br />
Has sprung between us, that we cannot see<br />
The father as he is? as others did?<br />
Am I not greater than all earthly Kings?<br />
He spake our fathers, wherefore is he hid<br />
That I cannot behold him? Let his wings<br />
Be folded for a while, as he comes down,<br />
That we may see him as he is; we came<br />
To choose a god, whom we, indeed, can see;<br />
Or, if his face be burnished with a flame<br />
Too great for our uncovered eyes, then we<br />
Are satisfied to close them in the smile<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Of one so radiant; so we feel him near,<br />
"But we must know his presence for the while;<br />
Speak Kohen! why can ye not bring him here?"<br />
<br />
Then answered Kohen: "Urge me not, O King!<br />
Ye know not what ye ask, if ye do seek<br />
To see him as he is. A nameless thing,<br />
A brow-bedabbled man, upon whose cheek,<br />
Sheds everyday God's sunshine; shall he ask<br />
That a decree be broken, and presume<br />
To lift unhallowed voice? Though in a mask<br />
Jehovah hides his presence, yet, the bloom<br />
Of every flower, is but the blush he brings<br />
Upon the face of nature, as he looks<br />
Abroad upon his creatures; and she sings<br />
From her ten thousand voices in his praise.<br />
Wake to his chorus! 'Ancient of the Days,'<br />
Wake children! and your faith shall blossom into wings."<br />
<br />
"Prate ye to fools," the incensed Monarch cries,<br />
"Nor gabble longer of your hidden Lord;<br />
Who follows in his wake, this moment dies,<br />
And Isis and eternal keep my word.<br />
We have a score of hidden deities<br />
And yet, they leave us, without aid or thought,<br />
And pestilence comes in and blocks our ways<br />
And where can our <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'deliverence'">dilverance</ins>  be bought?<br />
Show the bare hand of infinite decree,<br />

Strike! strike the chords! while we invoke the gods,<br />
And with the music let our souls be blended,<br />

'All stripling deities, and thus our strife be ended.'"<br />
Then rose a blast of sound upon the air<br />
And blended with it was the voice of song,<br />
The chime of music with the moan of prayer&mdash;<br />
A nation's thirst; deep, earnest and impassionately strong:<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O God of gods! be with us when we pray,</span><br />

"Behold! behold, his face!"<br />
A hand is pointed to the sun;<br />
"Behold! and be ye not afraid,<br />
To-day, be life, once more begun;<br />
Look ye upon his face, and learn to live,<br />
Look ye upon his face and learn to die;<br />
His hand alone deliverance can give,<br />
His light, alone, can frame the soul's reply.<br />
'Hear me! ye sons of men'; all eyes were turned;<br />
A stranger in their midst, whose dark eye burned<br />
With an unearthly gleam, yet black as night.<br />
It had no heavenly radiance, yet, was bright<br />
With a mysterious blaze, that pierced the soul<br />
As with an arrow to its inmost part,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>His form, in keeping with his face, made whole<br />
<br />
"A man well fitted to command; a heart<br />
That seemed to throb with some great passion; pent<br />
And seething into purpose; his black face<br />
Shone like a mirror-hood of his design.<br />
His words, and his strange presence in the place<br />
Gave him enraptured audience, that no one dared decline.<br />
<br />
"Hear me, ye sons of men: I am not come<br />
To woe ye to destruction; but, to save;<br />
The color of my face betrays my birth,<br />
I am Mizraim's race; but of mankind<br />

I will not speak, as he has feigned to speak,<br />
Who claimed before me, sponsorship from God;<br />
But I will make it plain that he deceived.<br />
Our fathers tell of Noah and the ark,<br />
And also tell of Shinar, and the time<br />
Of the dispersal. It is not enough<br />
To come with empty declamation, come<br />
With platitudes of love, and softened terms<br />
Of parenthood, and then to dash it all&mdash;<br />
The yearning love of children, to the earth,<br />
By words that are icicled up from death:<br />
'Ask not to look upon my face again,<br />

<br />
"Shame! shame on the pretender thus to bring<br />
Your expectations to the pitch of pain,<br />
The summit of your hope, where, to move on<br />
Is only to descent and sorrow; thus<br />
To multiply his attributes of good,<br />
And to describe a god so like the true,<br />
The ever shining Sun, and then deny<br />
The precious boon of sight; what mockery!<br />
When there he stands, (eternity, as young,)<br />
The broad, full shining orb, to look upon;<br />
The ever radiant Arbiter of earth,<br />
The great 'I am' of love; the very soul<br />
Of tenderness; rising every morn<br />
To kiss his sleeping children from their beds,<br />
Enwrapping them, with all his piercing warmth;<br />
Wooing the fragrant flowers from the earth,<br />
And warming all existences to life.<br />
<br />
"How can the soul be blind, when such a pledge<br />
Stands in eternal witness of its love?<br />
The very rocks would break their raptured trance,<br />
If man find not his voice in fervent praise.<br />
How do the waters mirror up his face!<br />
And tremble into waves at his advance.<br />
The universe goes laughing into life<br />
Each morn at his approach, and all the world<br />
Forgets its wakefulness, when the tired wing<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>Of day is folded, and himself withdraws<br />
<br />
"To teach us faith in him till he return;<br />
Thus every night his promise, and each morn<br />
His gracious fulfillment, filling the year<br />
With ripened sheaves of his remembrances.<br />
<br />
"We measure power by our necessities;<br />
Let him forget the dawning of one day,<br />
Or leave us through the circle of one moon,<br />
(Which were the same to him but for his love,)<br />
By what conception would we feel our loss?<br />
While yet the year is young, we scatter seed,<br />
And wait his fervid rays to fructify.<br />
The trees put forth their bloom, that his embrace<br />
May ripen into fruit; and not a growth<br />
But climbs his rays to full development.<br />
When Nature points with her ten thousand hands<br />
To him, the almighty framer of it all,<br />
Shall man forget his duty and fly off<br />
On the unnumbered tangents of the brain?<br />
Rather let break our voices in his praise,<br />
And let each human soul, be safely borne,<br />
Back to his many-chambered paradise.<br />
<br />
"Down on his rays man rode into the world,<br />
And if we wander not, the same broad path<br />
Is open for our exit; there is room<br />
In his broad campus for the royal race.<br />
Our bodies are of dust, and will return;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>Only the vital spark, the shining way<br />
<br />
"Ere traversed; and that alone goes back<br />
To join the maker in the increate,<br />
The golden chambers of eternal light.<br />
Look on these eyes! have they not more than Earth<br />
In their deep glance? I know whereof I speak;<br />
For I was led, in trancehood to the sun,<br />
And in his very chambers have I walked,<br />
And at his very throne have I bent down<br />
To praise him; multitudes were there, who knelt<br />
As I did kneel, in rapturehood and prayer.<br />
<br />
"High in the midst, sole source of life and light,<br />
The glowing center of the shining orb<br />
Sat the unchanging god; his face was that<br />
Of manhood magnified; upon his cheek<br />
Was more than woman's beauty deified.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O! once to look and live, is all the soul,</span><br />
Though it be triply strengthened, can endure,<br />
Till it do pass from this clay tenement<br />
Into the morrow of the upper world;<br />
But we may now and always climb the rays<br />
That spring from his own countenance, and see<br />
The reflex of his face; but of his form,<br />
But little can be printed on our sight.<br />
Enough, to know he lives, and is our life,<br />
And every morning he doth search us out,<br />
And lift the burden from our heavy lids,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>That we may rise with him and to our tasks!<br />
<br />
"Shall we be hushed, when every bird and flower<br />
Doth herald his approach? Convolvulus<br />
Waits for his coming with its lips apart,<br />
And Philomela will not close his note,<br />
Till he do answer with his smiling face;<br />
Thus the whole earth resolvent into song<br />
Waits for his footsteps&mdash;how can we be dumb!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">"There was a song</span><br />
Which flowed, untutored, from the lips of love,<br />
The ransomed ones that knelt before his throne,<br />
No earthly tongues its echo could repeat,<br />
So much there was of love, so much of joy,<br />
So much of tenderness and innocence;<br />
For they were without guile, and not a word<br />
But breathed of faith, dependency and peace.<br />
It praised him for his sufference of earth,<br />
That he did bear its sin, yet did not smite;<br />
And only once, in anger, hid his face,<br />
And oped the heavens, to wash out its filth;<br />
Yet, with his fervent rays, drank up the flood,<br />
And set his bow a witness that again<br />
Never should earth be flooded, while the years<br />
Melt into centuries, till the whole race,<br />
With aching hearts and scalding eyes shall come<br />
Back to his all-embracing fatherhood.<br />
<br />
"They thanked him for his witness-watch of man,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>That time and time, his face was partly hid,<br />
"To show the hazard of our wandering steps,<br />
That in the early, and the latter rain,<br />
He wept for our refreshment, till his tears<br />
Shut out his fervent glances from our eyes;<br />
And though he mourned our strangerhood of him,<br />
Yet would he teach us that in smiles and tears<br />
Are we begotten, and our lives are lost<br />
If we find not the blessings that are hid<br />
Beneath the rainbow tints of sorrowing.<br />
<br />
"Thus much, and more, that I will not essay;<br />
But I was led through fields and garden walks,<br />
And ornate grandeur, which the earth affords<br />
Nor pattern nor approach; and though the mind<br />
Be forced to utmost tension, it cannot<br />
Encompass the bewilderment of sight.<br />
Since my return, I cannot cast it off,<br />
It lingers with me like some raptured dream,<br />
And in my eyes and on my face is drawn<br />
The print of its unspeakable surmount;<br />
And I would call it dream, if I had not<br />
A talisman, that tells me of its truth.<br />
An angel led me to the central throne,<br />
An angel led me back to consciousness;<br />
But ere he passed the confines of the sun,<br />
He handed me a clear, transparent gem,<br />
And called me: 'Uri, thus it shall be said:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>The very god commands that it be done;<br />
<br />
"'Uri, my light, my fire upon the earth,<br />
Shall build again my altars and restore<br />
With his own hand, the priesthood of the sun.<br />
I will a hundredfold return the scorn<br />
Of Mizraim on himself, for his neglect;<br />
And from the sons of Lud I will raise up<br />
A kingdom that shall shine in righteousness.'<br />
<br />
"This said, he handed me the talisman;<br />
Which, when our altars shall have been prepared,<br />
And laden with the choicest of our flock,<br />
Shall claim the pledge of the eternal one,<br />
With fire from his own courts to burn it up.<br />
<br />
"I can not say how long, or short a time,<br />
I lingered thus entranced; I only know<br />
I waked to find it real. The precious gem<br />
Is proof of disenchantment; it is here.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I lay no claim on priesthood, but have told</span><br />
The plain, uncumbered truth; when I did fall,<br />
Prone to the earth in trance, I had no thought,<br />
Of what would come of it; you have it all.<br />
I have the stone, and we will test its power.<br />
If yonder priest, with his enshrouded myth,<br />
Desires to measure lances with the sun,<br />
Then we will each build altars to our gods,<br />
And he that first draws fire from any source,<br />
Not of the earth, shall claim the forfeiture<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Of all the other's tenantry to teach.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I may have said too much; I can not more</span><br />
Than leave the rest with god, the changeless one,<br />
The bright, all-shining universe of love,<br />
The unfailing source, the broad, unvarying stream,<br />
The very oceanhood of deity."<br />
<br />
He ceased; and Kohen, rising to his feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gave back the challenge eagerly; as might</span><br />
The athlete spring his ready foe to meet;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His, was the conscious power of fearless right:</span><br />
"Let him lift up his altars to the sun,<br />
And I will call upon the Uncreate,<br />
The hand, that shaped it from chaotic void,<br />
The face, whose look first taught it how to smile.<br />
He may call first, that it may vantage him;<br />
But other than the earth can no man bring,<br />
Fire from the distant realms, except it be<br />
From God, Creator of the sun, the moon and stars.<br />
I am content that he do cry his god,<br />
Till he be hoarse with hardihood of prayer,<br />
This day shall judge between us and the right,<br />
And ye shall see the bare arm of the Lord."<br />
<br />
The crowd, impatient of his words, did shout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Uri's acclamation; as the sun,</span><br />
Full-faced and warm, gave back his witnesshood;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His ready conquest had been well begun.</span><br />
How few there be, who see beyond their sight!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even in our day of peculence and power,</span><br />
The horizon of man has been his might,<br />
Beyond his ready reach he passes into night;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The world is bounded by its present hour.</span><br />
No marvel that old Uri swept the field;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His snare was baited for their ready sense,</span><br />
No effort theirs, a pleasure but to yield;<br />
Theirs but the open book, to them unsealed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They felt no weight of future recompense;</span><br />
And so they shouted, high and loud, his praise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Till he recalled them, with his magic voice:</span><br />
"Old Kohen seems in earnest; let us raise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our altars quickly, that we may rejoice</span><br />
This day, in our great father's warm embrace,<br />
That we may look unblushing in his face<br />
And call his fervent rays to their full test<br />
Ere he shall draw the curtain in the west."<br />
<br />
So said, so done; two altars were soon reared,<br />
Both prophets, in full confidence appeared;<br />
The offerings have been brought; and now they wait<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only the word; the King must give command.</span><br />
Against gray Kohen, was the leveled fate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his unsolaced anger; yet, his hand</span><br />
Was stayed by counsel, and he only said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Uri calls first, let every breath</span><br />
Be hushed upon his calling. Let the dead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From out their cerements beneath</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>Bear witness with our spirits that we seek<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"A true solution to the psalm of life.</span><br />
Slay thou the offering, Uri, and then speak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Speak the charmed word, and close the strife."</span><br />
<br />
Uri comes forth and in one hand he brings<br />
The talisman with leathern circlet stayed,<br />
Enclosing surfaces convex; to this he clings<br />
As though the whole earth in the balance laid,<br />
Were mean in weight compared to such a gem.<br />
The other holds a knife, and with a stroke<br />
The offering is prepared; he looked at them,<br />
The thirsting, hungry eyes that watch, then broke<br />
The silence, turning full upon the sun:<br />
"Thy will, most radiant god! thy will be done.<br />
O shining face! of the unchanging one,<br />
Look, in the pity thou alone canst feel<br />
And lead us back to life, we claim thy pledge.<br />
A nation, lifts to thee their centered prayer;<br />
They see thy smile, they know thy heart of hearts.<br />
They hush them here, upon their altar's brink,<br />
For they can go no nearer; meet, thou, them,<br />
And, as we look upon thy face, may we<br />
Behold thy very presence in our midst;<br />
Come as a flame, to lick this offering up,<br />
And all our hearts shall melt into thy smile."<br />
<br />
He raised the gem before the flaming sun;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>The rays concentered, and the flames burst forth<br />
As leaping to their master. 'Twas enough.<br />
The multitude, in thought, became as one.<br />
And all, save Kohen, sank upon their knees;<br />
And whispers of relief, fell on the breeze.<br />
They were as pliant clay in Uri's hands,<br />
And hung upon the breath of his commands:<br />
"Pour forth your homage, chosen of the sun,<br />
Once more his warmth encloses; and we feel<br />
Responsive throbbings of his fatherhood.<br />
Rise and rejoice!" Their ready voices raise<br />
From lips, new touched in unison of praise.<br />
<br />
Old Kohen was confounded at the first.<br />
He had not thought it possible, to bring<br />
Fire from the sun, or any mortal thing;<br />
No shadow of its secret on him burst;<br />
But he had heard of sorcery and arts<br />
Among the sons of Mizraim, and not long<br />
Before the lion of his nature starts,<br />
In cold defiance of the clamorous throng,<br />
To slay his offering; and his lips poured out<br />
The very thunder-throe of earnest prayer;<br />
A fervency that would not harbor doubt,<br />
That ever is a stranger to despair.<br />
Long, earnest, loud and fervently, he prayed;<br />
And his gray locks ensilvering the breeze,<br />
Gave pathos, to the torrent thus unstayed;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Yet, not for self, did he the angel seize;<br />
But wrestled for his people thus misled.<br />
"Unscale their eyes, O Father!" so he pled.<br />
"Unstop their ears, O thou, All Powerful One<br />
That they may hear thy footfall on the wind.<br />
Come in thy flame, and purge them with thy fire.<br />
Strike off the fetters from their prisoned souls!<br />
Make me an offering for their flagrant sins,<br />
And I will bare my bosom to the knife,<br />
And bend my neck in cheerfulness to thee,<br />
So thou wilt save my people from the hand<br />
Of this misguided witch of Mizraim!"<br />
His prayer had hardly ceased, ere shot the flame,<br />
From upper zenith, down, and in one glow,<br />
Pierced the whole altar with impetuous claim,<br />
And lapped the other with its overflow.<br />
The crowd, transfixed with wonder at the scene,<br />
Could hardly trust the witness of their eyes,<br />
And held divided counsels, till the King<br />
Quenching the current of their late surprise,<br />
Poured his recruited anger on Kohen.<br />
<br />
"Why longer parley, with a thing so plain?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Kohen had no <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'warrent'">warrant</ins>  for this deed;</span><br />
The palm was Uri's who did rightly gain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fire from the sun, to him alone, we plead;</span><br />
He drew it first, old Kohen must admit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he should paid due homage to our god;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>And from what source did his become enlit?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"We serve no phantom, with its hidden nod,</span><br />
But look upon the face of him we serve;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun has kept his fire for us these years,</span><br />
And we, his children, never can deserve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His untold blessings; though our prayers and tears,</span><br />
Should mingle with each altar that we raise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all the future ages, still our debt</span><br />
Will always be uncancelled by our praise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all our past be covered with regret.</span><br />
We want no juggling on this sacred day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That gives us back the father, we had lost.</span><br />
Bind old Kohen, and hasten him away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He shall repay his treachery with cost.</span><br />
To-morrow shall another altar grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This precious grove, made sacred to the sun,</span><br />
And Kohen shall be offered in this place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To pay the sacrilege he had begun."</span><br />
<br />
In thy own way our Father; we must wait<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So many times, because we cannot see;</span><br />
Yet thou alone canst bring us to the gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How slowly do we learn to trust in thee!</span><br />
Yet, in withholding, are the blessings hid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As frequent as in giving; all our prayers</span><br />
If they result in doing but thy bid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will scatter diamond dust above our cares.</span><br />
The gray old Prophet murmured: "Let God's will<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be done, and in abeyance I will bare my breast,</span><br />
"I will not doubt him though indeed he kill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His chosen way must surely be the best."</span><br />
<br />
The morrow came and at the King's command<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The multitude assembled, and the guard</span><br />
Brought forth the Prophet, looking proudly grand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As some great warrior claiming his reward</span><br />
Of beys and laurels, wreathed into a crown;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They rear the pile and he awaits his doom</span><br />
Without a menace, and without a frown.<br />
Then turning to the press: "I will assume<br />
Your hearts are mine, my sons, I know it well;<br />
Your eyes beheld the witness of our God,<br />
And greatly were ye moved; but 'tis his will<br />
That I should join my fathers in that land,<br />
Where canker and corruption never comes,<br />
The why, and wherefore of it, is his own;<br />
I bow my head in thankfulness to him,<br />
That he has deemed me worthy to exchange<br />
A life of sorrow for a crown of love.<br />
<br />
"Ye are the servants of an earthly King,<br />
And God has suffered him to lead you off,<br />
His will be done; but I must tell you now<br />
Your future as I read it in the glass<br />
Of my illumined death:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">"I see the black</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>Of Mizraim, sweep the brown of Lud from off<br />
The face of Egypt; and I also see<br />
A wandering race, go northward, and to east;<br />
I see a bitter wintering of snow;<br />
I see the sun hide back his face from them;<br />
I see a boisterous buffeting at sea;<br />
I see a journey southward&mdash;a new world."<br />
<br />
"And centuries flow swiftly on my sight.<br />
A people proudly resting in their wealth;<br />
The Son of God, in the full flight of years;<br />
The conquest of the nations in his name.<br />
A proud and prosperous people cross the sea<br />
And swoop upon this nation of the sun;<br />
Their temples crumble in the hand of God<br />
And he takes back his own. All this I see<br />
As what cannot avert; it is God's way,<br />
And wisdom is the wastage of his throne.<br />
He cannot order wrongly; I submit<br />
My wasting image to his waiting hands:<br />
"Come Father! I am ready."<br />
<br />
He raised him to the pile; with look divine,<br />
He prone himself upon it; at the sign<br />
The Prophet Uri raised the crystal stone;<br />
The sun threw down its rays, and shot the flame<br />
Full to the center; as the altar shone,<br />
Each eye was turned, and every voice was tame,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>As down the chancel of the deep blue sky,<br />
A flaming chariot sped, and came a cry:<br />
"It is enough, come higher up; thou shalt<br />
Not suffer death." A hand, not human, caught<br />
The grand old Prophet; his recumbent form<br />
Rose on their dazzled sight as rainbow in the storm.<br />
<br />
Thus was the error fixed; and it is well<br />
We leave them to their blindness for a while.<br />
Misguided worship, left alone, will tell<br />
Its own pathetic story: there is guile<br />
To underlie each sorrow of the race.<br />
Fruit comes alone from seed; somewhere is sown<br />
The germ of every grief, and nature on its face<br />
Bears no repentant feature; as we plant, so shall the tree be grown.<br />

<div class='title'>EXPULSION FROM EGYPT.</div>

<div class='poem2'>
The seasons pass, till on their hands they count<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Four palms, and to the third, a score and three</span><br />
In life's meridian how the circles mount<br />

No canker worm that clogs the ready wheel;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If care hangs not upon the skirts of time;</span><br />
And if, like most mankind, we only feel<br />

In ambling, easy way, and retrospect<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Surprises into thought, and we wake up</span><br />

Which we have mixed we drink; if it be gall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We gulp it down the same; we cannot change</span><br />
The current of our lives, and useless is the call<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On any but the hand of God. 'Tis strange</span><br />
The miracle of life should ever pass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And print no letters deep into the soul!</span><br />
The years go by, and, but the tuft of grass<br />

<div class='title'>MIZRAIM AND LUD.</div>

<div class='poem4'>
Near the rim of Karoun, where the pyramids drink the dew that should dampen the soil;<br />
And the Nilus pours over its green level banks, its annual freightage of spoil;<br />
Where the date ripens dark to the child of the sun, and the pomegranate colors for fruit;<br />
The ibis is sounding the damps of the land, and earth in its plethory mute.<br />
<br />
The fat of the fields husks the voice of the morn, while Demeter <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'isweighing'">is weighing</ins>  her sheaves;<br />
The lotus has honied its lips for the kiss, "and the turtle in mockery grieves."<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>What is that, where the Orient gathers her gold, and the eye wanders back to the sea?<br />
What cloud on the horizon's breach can be seen? What wakens the vulture's rude glee?<br />
<br />
'Tis the shock of the battle that burdens the air, and the armies that burden the eye;<br />
They have met (could Elysian give landscape more fair?), have met to embrace and to die.<br />
The Prophet still lives, and has led to the sun all Egypt; and gathered as one<br />
The people to hallow the harvest-moon feast, ere the work of the year is done.<br />
<br />
But Mizraim outnumbers the children of Lud, and the shepherd kings, crafty and weak,<br />
Have laid tasks on their shoulders too heavy to bear, till the voice of their burden must speak.<br />
In vain the gray Prophet lifts up to his god his winglet of prayer for peace;<br />
The tempest of war has broke over the plain, and his altars can bring no surcease.<br />
<br />
The black and the bronze, the iron and brass; how they struggle and grip for the field!<br />
The spear and the arrow, the halbert and lance, and who shall be first to yield?<br />
Not the iron; it is strong and resistless in weight. Not the brass; it is beaten and firm.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>What a hecate of agony burdens the plain! what a banquet for vulture and worm!<br />
But the iron is too heavy, the brass is too thin, and under the weight it gives way,<br />
As a wall, that is breached and toppled by time; and Mizraim gains the day.<br />
</div><div class='poem3'><br />
Oppression, when reversed, is double weight;<br />
The Slave pours lead into the lash he bore;<br />
And, as the Master adds recruited hate<br />
To blows, that he has learned to feel before,<br />
The soul its letters of forgiveness learns<br />
From only one great Master, in all time;<br />
Revenge is human, and forever burns<br />
Upon the trackway of retreating crime.<br />
The text and testwork of their lives was lost;<br />
And when the King was slain, and they o'erthrown,<br />
His people paid their tyranny with cost.<br />
<br />
Only the Prophet, with his magic stone,<br />
Could purchase their withdrawal; they must leave<br />
(They were the early jewels of the sun)<br />
And Uri pledged their fortunes to retrieve,<br />
If they would journey, where the day begun,<br />
And seek the closer presence of their god,<br />
In paths where human feet had never trod.<br />
They must divide with Egypt; but go out<br />
Well laden for the journey; should they dare<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>To turn, the heavy hand of Mizraim would not spare.<br />
<br />
&AElig;gyptus! thou above thy gates hath writ<br />
So many times the monosylbic "when."<br />
We, weary of conjecture; round us flit<br />
The phantoms of the past; and we again<br />
Pass in review thy pages, black with mold;<br />
Intemporate within a crumbling earth,<br />
Against the char of empires thou dost hold<br />
The charms that emulate immortal birth.<br />
We write mutation on the brow of Time;<br />
Thou art the changeless one of all the world&mdash;<br />
Thou hast no brotherhood in any clime;<br />
All mortal barbets have in vain been hurled.<br />
<br />
"Time conquers all things?" Thou giv'st back the lie;<br />
Above its ruins, thou dost stand, serene&mdash;<br />
Eternity!&mdash;Must thou, perforce, then die?<br />
What tragedy hast thou, indeed, not seen?<br />
Must thou, too, look on death? thou wilt not dim;<br />
But in impassive slumber, thou wilt fall<br />
As sinks the sun, beneath the horizon's rim,<br />
And answer only the Archangel's call.<br />
We leave thee loathely, for our souls are wed<br />
To thy enchanted gardenhood of lore.<br />
"The morning stars sang joy" above thy bed,<br />
The nations, in their cerements, shall pass thy door,<br />
And earth be wrapped in ashes ere thy brow shall bear the fatal legend, "Nevermore."<br />

<div class='title'>THE MOURNING SHEPHERDS</div>

<div class='poem2'>
The tambour' is silent, O god of the Nile!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The harp has been hung in acacian shade.</span><br />
We are bowed to the earth, we are broken and bent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the blade of our fathers in dust has been laid.</span><br />
<br />
We came, as the simoom creeps over the plain;<br />
We came, as the tiger its covert forsakes;<br />
As the hurricane brushes the dust from the brakes;<br />
As the lightning leaps out and the thunder-god shakes.<br />
<br />
We are shorn of our strength as with plague we are smote;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The axe has been wrenched from the hands that are brawn,</span><br />
And the arms whose strong sinews till now were unbent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have been broken as brittles; our prowess is gone.</span><br />
<br />
O! thou bright shining god! with thy scintles of gold;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If thy children have gathered the glow of thy face,</span><br />
If thy kisses, ere warmed to the lips that are cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O we pray! let us feel thy impassioned embrace.</span><br />
<br />
We are journeying forth to the cradle of morn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where thy lids feel the weight of their slumbering still;</span><br />
We would kneel at thy bed where the seasons are born,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And learn from thy lips the whole law of thy will.</span><br />
<br />
Have we sinned in thy sight? have we slackened our pace?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are we paying the forfeit in wormwood of shame?</span><br />
We draw nearer to thee, and our lives we would place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hands of the Maker, that out of thy flame</span><br />
<br />
We may gather that fire that shall glow with thy love;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And will never grow dim through the future of years,</span><br />
That shall make us like thee, and our fealty prove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Till we learn to forget this dark trackhood of tears.</span><br />
<br />
As we turn to the East, wilt thou smile on our way?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wilt thou lessen the distance between us and thee?</span><br />
Or our hearts remain hungry, the shadow still stay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With its wizard arm lifted to smite as we flee.</span><br />
<br />
We doubt thee no longer&mdash;we know thou wilt aid;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We turn to the path where thy morning rays shine;</span><br />
We will seek thy first footfall, and all unafraid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We feel thee, we love thee, we know we are thine.</span><br />
<br />
We leave the old life, with the graves of our kin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We turn from the sunset of dampness and death,</span><br />
We turn where the light with its god doth begin,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the praise of the day-king embalms every breath;</span><br />
<br />
Where the sun slakes his thirst with the dew of the flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the night flees before him far into the west,</span><br />
Where the honey-dew <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'clingsto'">clings to</ins>  the fruit-laden hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the soul sets its table, with Joy as its guest.</span><br />
<br />
So does our faith stand out against our grief;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>So does our hope grow up into belief.<br />
One God? Yes, Father, Thou! and only One.<br />
We praise thee; yet, our praise is only done,<br />
When we extol thee for the gift of faith.<br />
Not every one can name thee; but each breath<br />
May be enladen with the thought of praise<br />
And all adore thy attributes&mdash;the ways<br />
That they adore thee are not always thine;<br />
Yet, do they bend to thy great thoroughfare and shine<br />
With light from the Eternal throne; 'tis well,<br />
Nor otherwise than good&mdash;it can but swell<br />
The choral of thy praise; and in the end<br />
These thousand thoughts of Deity, in thee, not fail to blend.<br />

<div class='title'>THE JOURNEY.</div>

<div class='poem'>
O thou! who charmed the demons in the breast<br />
Of Saul, and set the universal voice<br />
Of all the earth to thy unflagging song;<br />
Thou royal shepherd! bend for us across<br />
The bridge of ages thy leant lips, and pour<br />
The echo of thy music on our souls.<br />
<br />
And Thou of Nazareth! whose very life<br />
Was as the cadence of a well-strung harp,<br />
Thyself the instrument, upon whose strings,<br />
Ten thousand symphonies are left entranced;<br />
Pour in the empty vial of our verse,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>Some of thy soul of music, and let shine<br />
Through every darkened crevice of the heart,<br />
Rays of celestial sunshine. Not in vain<br />
Our humble dalliance, if thou set the charm<br />
Of thine approval. Let our song be praise<br />
And devotate our hands, that there be left<br />
No tissue, but is animate of Thee!<br />
<br />
The seas reach out to clasp each other's hands,<br />
The greater and the less, and leap the sands<br />
That tear in two their waters; but not so<br />
She of the Nile; her rights will not forego.<br />
The hand that rocks the crib of empire holds<br />
A charm, that locks the East and West in one<br />
The track of nations is her beaten path,<br />
And undisputed, till the earth be done.<br />
Man may disturb it, but the hand of God<br />
Has placed a thousand tokens on this sod.<br />
<br />
The flocks are gathered, and the flight began,<br />
Old Uri and attendants in the van;<br />
The portents were of good as far as seen,<br />
Each breast a shrine of hope; thus early man<br />
Gave little time to sorrow&mdash;after years<br />
Were left for its fruition; light of heart,<br />
These early-planted germlets of the earth,<br />
Took their reverses in the better part<br />
Of hardihood; they had thus early learned,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>That in the chafe of fortune there is gain;<br />
That scars are coronets, though they be burned<br />
Deep in the brow of care; each gem a pain.<br />
Our philosophic age with heavy draught,<br />
Drinks deep in phantasies, but fails to learn<br />
The wiser lesson of this early craft,<br />
To catch the wheel of fortune with each turn.<br />
<br />
East over Syria they bent their steps,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meeting Euphrates many leagues above</span><br />
Where Babylon since molded into form<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her mystical proportions; and so strove</span><br />
Persistently the mastery of earth.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crossing the Tigris but a span below,</span><br />
Where Taurus from his fountains feeds the stream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They traverse Persia with its after-glow</span><br />
Of conquest; where Ispahan gave touch,<br />
To chords that deify the voice of song,<br />
And mellow through the ages, if so much<br />
As but an echo would inspire the tongue,<br />
With that enchantment, that rolls down the course<br />
Of her great history. We seek in vain<br />
Another Cyrus, or another force<br />
Of Scripture fulfillment, with lesser pain,<br />
And Time's repleted garner has no riper grain.<br />
<br />
Still East they cross the Amoo, and above<br />
Where now, Bokhara's languor and repose<br />
Invites the Sclavic hordes in summer quest<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Of forage. And Belor, giant like, still throws<br />
Its shadow o'er the landscape; and the Koosh<br />
Shortens the noon of summer, from the South;<br />
A thousand sparkling torrents downward rush,<br />
And pour their waste of waters in the mouth<br />
Of Indus. They cross where Belor melts its snow,<br />
To placid Cashgar's arms, sending below<br />
A current to the waste of farther Nor.<br />
They stand on Cobis' southern girt, and drink<br />
The final retrospective of the West;<br />
And keep the gloomy borders to the brink<br />
Of far-off Koulon, where the Argoon lends<br />
Its mite of wastage to the vast Amour;<br />
And the impetuous Shilka, swiftly sends<br />
Its tribute to the master of Mantchoor.<br />
<br />
One winter they had spent upon the way,<br />
Within the vale of Cashgar, where the flocks<br />
Found generous herbage; but they could not stay<br />
Longer than opening spring, when from the rocks<br />
And passes of the Koosh, a savage tribe<br />
Came fiercely on them; and again the fire<br />
From Uri's sacred pebble, as a bribe<br />
Saved them from ruin, and the warlike ire<br />
Of Lama's devotees, for even then<br />
On upper Ind, his worship had begun;<br />
But superstition, ranks us all as men,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>And mystery doth mold us into one.<br />
The Argoon and the Shilka passed; they keep<br />
Their steady march, down Armour's limpid tide.<br />
Yet summer wastes to autumn. Seasons creep<br />
So noiselessly, that our souls are open wide,<br />
If we set watch upon them; unaware<br />
They find us napping, in our wakeful age;<br />
And how much more, in the unrisen sun<br />
Of ancient man! We wonder that the page<br />
Is not more blurred and blotted in the years<br />
That are far gone, when knowledge only bubbled up through tears.<br />
<br />
A Winter on the Amour near the sea;<br />
The Frost King strokes his heavy beard in glee,<br />
In surfeit of his triumph, o'er the foe<br />
That dares invade his borders; and the snow<br />
Scatters its fleecy fullness o'er the land,<br />
Hiding the face of Nature with its hand<br />
So cold and clasping. O 'tis very hard!<br />
To see familiar faces pass the ward<br />
Of our immediate contact, and the earth<br />
Draw back into its arms, with tightening girth<br />
Our loved ones. But 'tis a heavier lot<br />
To see our mother Earth, whose faithful breast<br />
Has never failed to aid; so chilled in death<br />
That it cannot respond, though it be rest,<br />
Recuperent and needful; still the same<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>When we are starving for its warm caress,<br />
And cannot spare its nursing, when our claim<br />
Is mortal, and we feel the strong hand press<br />
Our vitals; and we labor for our breath;<br />
And Famine lends its wizard hand, to fill the tooth of death.<br />
<br />
Old Uri vainly calls the shining god;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though it may light his altar, still the flame</span><br />
Is but a weakling; and the weary host<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were wrangling at his impotence, and tame</span><br />
His efforts to assuage them. He had taught<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His followers of a near approach; the sun</span><br />
Seemed coy of his endeavors, for the thought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of zone or solstice, had not then begun,</span><br />
And Winter was their time of penance, when<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their god rode low, and frowned him out of sight.</span><br />
They offered for his anger many gifts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And set their watchmen to outwake the night.</span><br />
In question of his rising. Why should he<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Keep so much closer the horizon's rim</span><br />
When they were in his quest, and sought the verge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of farthest empire, in their reach of him?</span><br />
O empty arms! and ever reaching out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fold in the blessings that your hands enclose.</span><br />
There is nor reason, nor excuse for doubt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The river of God's love so near you flows.</span><br />
Your very feet are on the water's brink,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">His very arms are all around you thrown,</span><br />
You touch him in your timidness, and shrink<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his embraces; no human soul was ever yet alone.</span><br />
<br />
They settle down to Winter, and their flocks<br />
Must furnish sustenance, until the sun<br />
Shall break their penance, and embrown the locks<br />
Of the o'ergristled seasons; and this won,<br />
They counsel further movement. Uri speaks:<br />
"Sons of the Summer God, I little thought<br />
When we set out from Egypt, that our feet<br />
Would be thus bruised and bled; but it is well.<br />
We learn the lesson of our latent sin;<br />
This trial of our faith will make us whole,<br />
If we but draw the diamond out of it.<br />
We have not vainly trod the heavy press<br />
Of our affliction, if we firmly breast<br />
The waters. I have kept faithful watch&mdash;<br />
We are but self-styled lords, and forfeit much<br />
Of our asserted masterhood; the birds<br />
Make many less mistakes&mdash;we used to note<br />
The flight of waterfowl in Egypt. Why<br />
Should we not learn their wisdom in this clime?<br />
Before the sun sank low, and Winter came<br />
(Led by a providence that makes all things<br />
To minister our wants), I watched the birds,<br />
And many, turned to East, across the sea.<br />
We lose our way sometimes, they never do;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>They are much closer children to the sun<br />
Than we, by their dependence&mdash;we need help<br />
As much as any feathered wingster does&mdash;<br />
And yet we push it back, when we might reach<br />
And find a steady hand. Let us go to<br />
And make us ships; that when the Spring<br />
Shall beckon back to life the dormant earth,<br />
And all the birds turn back in countermarch,<br />
We fly against their flight, and reach the clime<br />
From whence the sun has warned them to return<br />
To this cold country of the nether earth.<br />
<br />
"Behold! these rugged trees stand stout for us,<br />
And ready for our architrave; and we<br />
Were better wont to labor than to dole<br />
Our time in murmurs at our fate. Up! up!<br />
And do! and though we suffer overmuch,<br />
Our labor shall not vainly mock at us.<br />
Even old Kohen saw a journey South,<br />
When he did burn our eyes, as he went up,<br />
And he saw fat and plenty in the land<br />
Where his prophetic eye did cast our lot;<br />
And we will not mistrust what leads to light,<br />
Though it be lifted in a demon's hand."<br />
<br />
The forests gave to them their virgin palms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they did rudely shape them into crafts;</span><br />
Made ready for the flood, when the warm sun<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should waken nature with enlivening draughts;</span><br />
But Spring wore into Summer, ere the birds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gave the unspoken pledge of their return.</span><br />
The sun, still coy, refused to climb as high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As it had done in Egypt; still they burn</span><br />
With new-born hope, as they float down to sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, moving counter to their winged friends,</span><br />
Cross to Lopatka, where they only wait<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Replenishment, which nature always sends,</span><br />
Where faith is instinct as in lower life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(The birds teach providence, without a chance,)</span><br />
And so they wander on, to the Aleutes;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passing and calling, as they still advance,</span><br />
They reach to where Alaska strikes the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In severance to meet them. They kept on,</span><br />
Feeding on eggs of seabirds, and the meats<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That everywhere supplied them. They have gone</span><br />
So far on Nature's very track, and now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A narrow river beckons their research,</span><br />
And they pass upward, till a mountain range<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Confronts their passage, like a royal perch</span><br />
From which the gods might frown their hardihood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For this intrusion of another world.</span><br />
But they have battled with the plague and flood;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And though Olympus all his thunders hurled,</span><br />
They had not turned; they saw the earnest need<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of pushing forward ere the sun turned back,</span><br />
And so they crossed to where the eastern slope,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Feeds the McKenzie. Here an easy track</span><br />
Leads down and cuts the stronger range in two,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A little while among its shadows grope,</span><br />
When the broad prospect opened to their view.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They follow the receding sun in hope,</span><br />
Still bearing to the east their steady trend,<br />
Hoping to win their God to close embrace;<br />
And morn and eve around their altars bend<br />
In thankfulness, that they still see his face.<br />
Through many valleys, virgin to their sight,<br />
And many lakes, whose bosoms never stirred<br />
To man, the weak pretender of God's might;<br />
But nature spreads her happy hearth with beast and flower and bird.<br />

<h2>PART SECOND.</h2>

<h2>AZTLAN.</h2>


<div class='title'>THE VALLEY OF THE MISSISSIPPI.</div>

<div class='poem2'>
Father of Waters! Nilus of the West!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou holdst thy secrets from the sons of men;</span><br />
A knowledge of the past which none would wrest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or wish to circumscribe with tongue or pen</span><br />
To the weak bonds of history; but rather stand<br />
With old De Soto on thy banks, and reverence the hand<br />
That drew the fetters from thy limbs, and set thee first at birth,<br />
On thy unmuzzled pilgrimage, without a peer on earth.<br />
<br />
Better thy unbroke seal, if it would teach<br />
The ponderous worm of destiny, called man;<br />
How great things may be hidden from his reach,<br />
And mighty things be silent, that his span<br />
Is but a hand-breadth to the great unknown,<br />
A thistle-down, before the breezes blown,<br />
That silent and unseen God turns the mighty mill,<br />
And on the brow of giant force he writes his words, "Be still."<br />
<br />
The possibles of time, are all thine own.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Thou hast not reared thy monuments of stone<br />
To overtop the pyramids, yet wrought<br />
In shapely mounds, thy sculpturehood, and caught<br />
From flying Time, the lustre of his wing,<br />
Which gives the semblance of perpetual Spring<br />
To thy vast lap of luxuries; in thee<br />
(Since man first pinioned thee to history)<br />
Is found the acme of a world's desire.<br />
Thy unknown crucial test, has passed the fire<br />
Of many fading centuries; let none inquire<br />
The secrets of thy conquest: be thou shut up with God,<br />
The master molding of his hand&mdash;the jewel of his rod!<br />
<br />
Yet in the book of Nature there is writ,<br />
Without exception, all her energies,<br />
As line by line, her page becomes enlit;<br />
Yielding to man some new and glad surprise,<br />
As Agassiz, together works with her,<br />
To make the earth, her own interpreter;<br />
And such a giant, must not hope to hide<br />
The unfading Sanscrit, written on its side.<br />
<br />
Thy brow wast glistered with the frost of years,<br />
Ere man's first rapture, at the sight of thee;<br />
Yet, were thy banks unswelled, by falling tears<br />
Till he tore back thy splendid tapestry&mdash;<br />
The bison and the deer unfrighted came<br />
To lave upon thy borders, all were tame,<br />
In their untoilsome frolics; and the beasts and birds<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>Made rolic at thy feet, in songs not marred with words.<br />
But sorrow comes with knowledge; 'tis the tree,<br />
That bears the samest fruit in every zone&mdash;<br />
The tale of Eden is no mystery,<br />
The tree will verify wherever grown.<br />
And yet, in God's own providence 'tis best,<br />
That Eden be repeated East and West;<br />
If knowledge in the first, brought sorrowhood to earth,<br />
The power to laugh and cry, were purchased at one birth.<br />
<br />
They stand upon thy borders: Mighty Stream!<br />
We will not pry thy silent lips apart,<br />
To ask thee when, and how, the Prophet's dream<br />
Reached its fulfillment; treasured in thy heart,<br />
Let it remain as many other things<br />
Are left; our language lessens their effect,<br />
And makes them small in words,&mdash;the very springs<br />
Of our existence, are not shown correct,<br />
When crowded into verbage,&mdash;so we lay<br />
Our beys upon thee, and we feel 'tis thine;<br />
Thine every secret, of the grand emprise,<br />
With only one unlicensed hand, the Hand of the Divine.<br />
<br />
It is enough that after waste and want<br />
And weariness of spirit they have found<br />
A rest upon thy margin, that thy arms<br />
Are opened to enclose them, and the sound<br />
Of human voices mingle with the notes<br />
Of myriad waterfowl. The thousand throats<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Of thy unmeasured pasture, blend in praise<br />
To the All Father for the countless ways<br />
That point his providence. The raven's cry<br />
Strikes never vainly, thy omniscient ear,<br />
No effort, but is answered "here am I,"<br />
No prayer but finds the parent very near.<br />
<br />
The unconscious hallelujahs of the plain,<br />
The untaught praises of the lofty trees,<br />
The waving upward palms of laden grain,<br />
The mellow notes upon the evening breeze,<br />
The "reveillies" from off the mountain tops,<br />
The nightingale's "tattoo," the many lips<br />
Touched only once by God, the faithful drops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wear unceasing at the granite mine,</span><br />
The praise that never sinks to prayer, the finger tips<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That span the universal zone of life; all, all incline</span><br />
To adoration. If we lose our way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(As these poor souls had done) we need but turn</span><br />
To catch the choral of the passing day.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behold on every branch and beam the altars burn!</span><br />
And all things beckon us of God, if we but bend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The enquiring ear, and catch the keynote of the mighty song</span><br />
That swells from all the universe; we too may blend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the vast concord, happiest of the throng.</span><br />
<br />
The rhythmal of the angels, is not far<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the first prattle of the infant's tongue</span><br />
Both caught the glitter of the Eastern star;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The harps were both, by the same Master strung;</span><br />
The glory of the one, glows from the face;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The other lifts, to meet its parent's kiss.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not very far, the border land of bliss,</span><br />
From every infant of the human race.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sacred fane of childhood, when first reared,</span><br />
How like a prophecy it should be read&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thing to be adored, and sometimes feared!</span><br />
So many unseen hands, smooth down the bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of infancy; we can but jostle with our utmost care</span><br />
Against angelic presences that bend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And print their unseen kisses on the brow,</span><br />
And with the infant earth, the Heavenly essence blend.<br />
<br />
The wheel that never tires, and ever turns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crushing the neck of nations in its round,</span><br />
Before whose tread, the star of empire burns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behind whose trend, the ridged and furrowed ground</span><br />
Gives mute quiescence, to the Master hand;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This wheel rolls on; and now upon thy banks</span><br />
Great River of the West the infant's cry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is mingled with the forest din; thy ranks</span><br />
Are opened to admit the "lullaby"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of earth's last entity; thou did'st not groan</span><br />
When buffalo and beaver found thy side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor when thy trees, first echoed to the moan</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>Of the despondent turtle, to his bride;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thou did'st smile on this invading race,</span><br />
And open thy broad prairies, as the palm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of some great hearted giant, to embrace</span><br />
The sea-tossed wanderers, the healing balm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of thy great heaving breast, rubbed almost out</span><br />
The wrinkles from the faces of these sires<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of early Egypt; they forgot the drought</span><br />
And mildew of their wanderings, and the fires<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of their thanksgiving altars, gave a zest</span><br />
They never yet had felt; an empire spread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Around them, in the flush of its full growth</span><br />
A bride, inviting the espousal bed.<br />
<br />
Their ranks had been depleted; yet a few<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still lingered with the Prophet, who had stood</span><br />
At the first altar; when the fervent sun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">First answered their entreaty, and the blood</span><br />
Was lapped by solar flame; and now, that peace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enshrines their hearts, and plenty spreads their board,</span><br />
They warm towards their leader, and return<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To their old-fashioned loyalty; his word</span><br />
Is sacred as the smiling of the sun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose burnished mirror likenesses their forms,</span><br />
And in whose bosom after life is done,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The weary find a shelter from all storms.</span><br />
Nor do they want a psalmist for his praise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he is found with ready harp and voice,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>To turn the multitude, with rapturous gaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the god of their unshaken choice.</span><br />
Their morning song is mingled with the mirth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That rolics from the sycamore and oak,</span><br />
The song that swells the green and fruent earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That needs no trumpet's blare, nor kettle stroke.</span><br />

<div class='title'>THE MORNING SONG OF THE MOUND BUILDERS.</div>

<div class='poem2'>
Once more do we turn on <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'they'">thy</ins>  face our glad eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Great god of the Summer! and sing,</span><br />
With the lark and the linnet we gladly arise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To welcome the smile of our King.</span><br />
<br />
Our hearts are made glad when we feel thee advance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On thy mission of mercy and might,</span><br />
For we know that the stroke of thy conquering lance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has shattered the bulwarks of night.</span><br />
<br />
We look on thy face, and our doubts are dispelled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the glance of thy mellowing eye;</span><br />
For we feel that the rains by our Master are held,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we fear not to do or to die.</span><br />
<br />
We felt thy embrace, many long weary years,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet the scales were not torn from our eyes;</span><br />
We sought for a father, with prayers and with tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till we woke with a welcome surprise.</span><br />
<br />
And beheld from thy face, <i>all</i> the fatherhood shine,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thy great glowing heart <i>all</i> ablaze</span><br />
With the love, that had lingered and grown more divine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the yearn of our wandering days.</span><br />
<br />
How we leaped to thy arms, when we saw them extend!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How we drank of thy fervent embrace!</span><br />
With its love like thyself, glowing on without end,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the gold of thy deified face.</span><br />
<br />
For our eyes were unscaled, and our hearts were unsealed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We were melted to tears at the thought,</span><br />
Of the blessings so near, that had stood unrevealed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the Providence waiting unsought.</span><br />
<br />
How could we have lost the firm grasp of thy hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With its daily improvise of love,</span><br />
With its unsounded depths, like the count of the sand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As an index, to point us above?</span><br />
<br />
And now hover o'er us, great god of the day!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let us never escape from thy wing,</span><br />
For ever and ever, drive famine away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give wealth to our Summer and Spring.</span><br />
<br />
Give us harvests of fruit, give us Winters of rest&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let thy Provident hand never cease;</span><br />
Grant the aged a home, on thy great shining breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When their labors shall purchase release.</span><br />
<br />
Be more than we <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'ask,give'">ask, give</ins>  us more than our prayer&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All our wants, let thy wisdom disclose,</span><br />

<div class='title'>EVENING THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER.</div>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sinking down to thy rest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In the deep crimson West,</span><br />
Great God! thou hast taught us repose;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With thy promised return,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Without doubting, we learn,</span><br />
To wait for thy further disclose.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In thy tenement high,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Blazing over the sky,</span><br />
Are thy sentinels, pledge of the night;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And we know by their shine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That thy care is divine,</span><br />
And we rest without fear, till the light<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Springs again from the East</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">With its glory increased</span><br />
By the wakening pulse of the day;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And we never will doubt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That thy naked arm, stout,</span><br />
Will drive all the shadows away.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Yet we cannot forebear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To lift up our prayer,</span><br />
For we know we are wanton and weak;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And if once thou shouldst fail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Or thy face shouldst grow pale,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where else in the world should we seek?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For a father so kind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To a people so blind,</span><br />
In our weakness, thy strength we may trace.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Then fail not to return,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Leave us never to mourn,</span><br />
The wealth of thy daily embrace.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">O continue, we pray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To bring back the glad day;</span><br />
Give us always, to look on thy face!<br />
<br />
The trembling lisp of every human soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of names more potent, then their own can be,</span><br />
Breathes the same lesson through, from pole to pole<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To prove the certitude of Deity.</span><br />
Not every eye turned upward can behold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The face that faith alone shapes into form;</span><br />
Not every hand can touch the gates of gold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That outward swing in welcome from the storm.</span><br />
Yet is the "Abba Father" pendant from each tongue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every soul a furnace for its fires;</span><br />
And sacred is each song in earnest sung,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When creature to Creator thus aspires.</span><br />
We blindly grope in this, our broad of day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The two eternities to thus unite;</span><br />
The silk of infancy is turned to gray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere we have learned to tread the path aright.</span><br />
We force our providences out of reach,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Throw back the hand our Father doth extend,</span><br />
And shut our ears that he may vainly teach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the wealth of heaven may expend</span><br />
To warm us to reliance,&mdash;shall we dare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To sneer at those who grope? We grapple air</span><br />
When it is all refulgent with our God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we may touch his garment's hem in prayer.</span><br />

<div class='title'>THE PROPHET'S DEATH.</div>

<div class='poem'>
Groping in undiscovered realms their way,<br />
The Prophet and his people give the day<br />
To finding safest lodgement, till they press<br />
Well down the grand old river, to the mouth<br />
Of the great Western confluent&mdash;the south<br />
Seems to add Summer to the wilderness.<br />
<br />
They cross the river, and then settle down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To love and labor on its grassy banks;</span><br />
And fortune seems to have forgot its frown.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Years of repletion fill their shattered ranks,</span><br />
And youth and vigor take the place of age;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The story of their journey is retold</span><br />
By only few in number; and the sage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who turned their faces on their god of gold,</span><br />
Was bent with the plethoric weight of years,<br />
And summoned them to worship 'mid the tears<br />
Of many, who misgave his failing strength;<br />
He saw their apprehensions and at length<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Called them together for a final word:<br />
"Sons of the Summer God! it is but wise<br />
That we look out beyond the brace of years,<br />
And question of the future. All the way<br />
The shining surface of our god has led<br />
Our toilsome footsteps; we must not forget<br />
His daily nurture, nor the cloth of gold<br />
With which he covers us&mdash;wakeful with the day,<br />
How has he touched our eyelids with his hands,<br />
And warmed us with his hovering! The night<br />
Has never failed his promise of the morn.<br />
How has his parenthood outwatched the stars;<br />
How has the Winter melted at his glance;<br />
How has his armor battled with the snows!<br />
With what a tenderness he decks the fields,<br />
And wooes the grasses from the dormant earth,<br />
And clothes the forest with its robes of green,<br />
As covert for the bison and the deer,<br />
That we may find replenishment of food!<br />
His providence has never failed our steps,<br />
Our homage cannot cancel his regard.<br />
<br />
"Our father! in this failing cup of years,<br />
Help us to be re-sanctified to thee&mdash;<br />
Thou hast not measured to our helplessness,<br />
But with unstinted hand filled up our lives<br />
With blessings. Fill thou alike our hearts,<br />
That we may have no room to cherish doubt,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>But answer thy embraces, as the fields<br />
Leap up to kiss thy first recumbent rays!<br />
Let all our dross become thy burnished gold,<br />
Shine through each crevice of our stubbornness,<br />
Till in transparent purity, we reach<br />
The very essence of thy godliness!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"Brethren of the Sun!</span><br />
This altar is my last: You see the fire<br />
Leap as an answer to my late request,<br />
And it shall bear my spirit to the sun,<br />
And cursed the hand that stays its homeward flight!"<br />
<br />
Fresh nerved he reached the altar with a bound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sank without a murmur in the flame;</span><br />
His followers an instant gather round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he had passed out almost as he came.</span><br />
<br />
They did not dare to drag him from the pile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His life and effort had together ceased,</span><br />
He passed into the future with a smile&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A smile, that he had been so quick released.</span><br />
Yet, there was one (clear-sighted from the rest),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who said she saw the essence of his form,</span><br />
In brighter effigy, more richly dressed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fly out into the sunset; and the charm</span><br />
Of her enchanted parable found faith<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In many of the multitude; his death,</span><br />
So like his life, had challenged all their thought<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they were ready to quiesce his fate, and sought</span><br />
Some shadowed miracle to wrap his shade.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They gathered up the ashes, and forbade</span><br />
Unsanctioned hands to touch them; and they reared<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A rugged mound above the garnered dust,</span><br />
And left him (one whom they loved less than feared).<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To that sole arbiter, whose name is Just,</span><br />
Our common parent, Time, whose busy hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rear many a sacred fane above our faults,</span><br />
Flings over our excressences his sands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leaves no human stain to blot the sacred marble of our vaults.</span><br />
<br />
How grand is the economy of time and death!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We whet the knife for deep incision on the name</span><br />
Of some misguided leader, but he fails his breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all our better angels give him back to fame;</span><br />
Death carries off the husk, we keep the ripened wheat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Time refines the kernel into choicest flour;</span><br />
The atmosphere of anger is at last made sweet;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our charity immortal glows; our passion, but an hour.</span><br />
God keep us always so! It is the chosen link<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That binds us to the race, and bids the Christ come in;</span><br />
That holds our hands to near the eternal brink;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It saves us from ourselves, and breaks the tooth of sin.</span><br />
<br />
The whitened garments at the eternal gate,<br />
Must cover those, who have not stained another,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>Or there will come that awful sentence: "Wait!<br />
"Blood crieth from the ground! where is thy brother?"<br />
If thus upon the living God doth set the seal<br />
Of condemnation for the false witnessing<br />
How will he smite the lips of those who steal<br />
His covering from the dead, and fill the sacred spring<br />
Of memory, with the debris of their lives;<br />
Mixing, what God has kindly torn apart,<br />
And making null, the severence he strives,<br />
Between the naked soul, and sin encumbered heart!<br />
<br />
The gem was melted, and his life went out<br />
In unobtrusive secrecy, and all<br />
That he brought with him, passed the silent way<br />
Into eternity, beyond recall.<br />
He chose no sponsor to renew his place<br />
But gave them back to Nature, as he found;<br />
Yet was his impress fastened on the race,<br />
And every morn they gathered at the mound,<br />
For many after years, till they had grown<br />
A nation strong in numbers, and had thrown<br />
The seeds of generation far and wide,<br />
And found the latent valleys without guide.<br />
The lakes are made a tribute to their spoil,<br />
And all the riches of the virgin soil<br />
Were tested by those hardy argonauts of old;<br />
And though they sought no fleece of shining gold,<br />
They penetrated all the wilderness<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>That lay unclaimed before them to possess.<br />
<br />
God drops no nobler anchorage on earth,<br />
Than those who mold a nation, and a name;<br />
Whose travail in the wilderness gives birth<br />
To some great epoch, without thought of fame.<br />
The pioneers of empire, for all time,<br />
Are gold-dust, from the placers of our homes&mdash;<br />
The surface croppings from a nation's prime,<br />
The mellow acre of the richest loams.<br />
They overgrow the boundaries of life,<br />
And push the horizon far out in space.<br />
With lethargy they wage a ceaseless strife,<br />
And with the whirling earth, they keep their pace.<br />
All honor to the soul who sets his stake<br />
Where human kind have never trenched before;<br />
Where only God his thunders o'er it shake,<br />
And solitude shall murmur, "nevermore."<br />
Such men are sovereigns, though they grasp no crown,<br />
And raise no jewelled scepter in the hand;<br />
Yet are they Princes, in their bronze and brown,<br />
And demonstrate their fitness to command.<br />
<br />
The Norsemen, on the North Atlantic wave;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Columbus, passing out in unknown seas;</span><br />
De Soto, gaining but an unknown grave;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hardy Pilgrims, on their bended knees;</span><br />
The Argonauts, upon the Western slope&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These are the souls no human praise can reach.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Each, in their turn, gave empire back to hope,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all are greater than the gift of speech.</span><br />
No pen can lustre their unfading claim;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No cenotaph do honor to their dust&mdash;</span><br />
These are crown jewels on the brow of Fame;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their conquest is supreme, their laurels ever just.</span><br />
<br />
Yet, in the van of empire, still is left<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The noiseless print of ancestry more grand;</span><br />
Indentures chiseled in the highest cleft,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By giants of a long forgotten land,&mdash;</span><br />
The nameless graves of centuries untold;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ashes of the prehistoric age;</span><br />
The self-forgetting litany of gold&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How vast their monuments, how broad their page!</span><br />
In what a grand democracy of death<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They lift their silent fingers to our years,</span><br />
Melt our memorials with a single breath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In mute companionship of life and tears!</span><br />
<br />
We are but pygmies to the almighty past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The names we honor but the surface-mould;</span><br />
Beneath must lie an empire far more vast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose fundaments alone deserve the name of "old."</span><br />
<br />
Not many years, till they had found the bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of copper ore upon Superior's rim;</span><br />
And hither many of the hardy ones were led<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Orchas, quick in architrave, and fleet of limb;</span><br />
And many the fantastic implements he shaped<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For husbandry; no want of theirs escaped</span><br />
His eager scrutiny&mdash;the axe and blade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rough-made pick, and the encumbered spade,</span><br />
The vessels for the housewife, and the spear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And other weaponry for bison and for deer.</span><br />
All these were fashioned in an uncouth way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet they filled the purpose of the day.</span><br />
<br />
They had not reached the iron age of thought,<br />
And what they made, necessity had taught;<br />
But riper years must ope the "Sampson Mine,"<br />
And wake the rugged giant, in the shine<br />
Of a meridian sunlight; they little thought<br />
Of what a Hercules remained unsought,<br />
So near Missouri's border; yet, not strange<br />
Is their indicted ignorance&mdash;their range<br />
Was circumscribed; and iron was left to rest,<br />
Till man had long been cradled on the breast<br />
Of patient Mother Earth&mdash;not all at once<br />
Did she give up her treasures; and the dunce<br />
Must grow into philosopher with years.<br />
Experience with its battlehood of tears,<br />
Is Nature's great interpreter; we learn<br />
But slowly, till the lessons fervid burn<br />
Their impress into action; then awakes<br />
The slow-taught pupil into higher life&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Invention is the furnace-spark of strife;<br />
Necessity, the hand that wields the sledge<br />
Upon the patient anvil of our needs,<br />
And Providence makes good its wakeful pledge<br />
With plenteous harvest; from the dormant seeds<br />
That lie unconed beneath our very feet<br />
We stumble on to marvels, and awake<br />
To find some giant force, in what we meet;<br />
And in the insects of our path, leviathans, we greet.<br />
<br />
Time's wheels, though shaken, never fail to track<br />
The rut of empire, without turning back;<br />
They, ceaseless whirl, with lubricate of blood,<br />
Drawn from a thousand channels on the way,<br />
Unrusting, through the oxydizing flood,<br />
To measure centuries, or mark a day.<br />
And thus, the primal pioneers move on<br />
To unaccustomed progress, on the banks<br />
Of the confluent streams that scar the face<br />
Of the great Western basin; and their ranks<br />
Are filled with happy husbandry; the land<br />
Gives back its tillage, with a lavish hand.<br />
<br />
The forests and the streams were over-full<br />
With fish, and flesh to feed them, and they pass<br />
One conquest, to another, in the lull<br />
Of untamed nature. Garnered as a mass<br />
To fill their open hands, the native corn<br />
Soon covered the rich valleys, and the plant,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>So dalliant to the race, was early born,<br />
Tobacco. They were not adamant<br />
Against the weaknesses so close allied<br />
To human nature; and there was excess,<br />
And envy, emulence, and pride,<br />
And all the ills that left their first impress;<br />
And yet God gave them peace. No brother's hand<br />
Was raised against a brother, and the years<br />
Spread fruit and plenty over a fair land<br />
Destined to futurehood of bitter, bitter tears.<br />

<div class='title'>DEPARTURE OF WABUN.</div>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Most governed is most wayward." Very true;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Repeating history doth verify</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That law from malefaction always grew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And with its ceasing, rulership must die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Except the common sway of Deity,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When love and service shall together blend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And man, from every earthly master free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall recognize his Father and his Friend.</span><br />
<br />
These ancient prairie dwellers, had no need<br />
Of stringent government; a few to lead<br />
In seeding and in harvest; some to guide<br />
In matters of religion, and of form;<br />
The rustic swain, and his compliant bride,<br />
To join in wedlock; and in time of storm,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>To smooth the little intricates of life<br />
With counsel, sage, and thus avoiding strife,<br />
To guide their budding nation into bloom.<br />
All claiming unction from the prophet's shade,<br />
Still gave their worship to the god of day,<br />
And their oblations on the altar laid.<br />
Yet, the responsive accident of fire<br />
Could never be recalled&mdash;they little knew<br />
The secret of its coming; and they shaped<br />
No other pebbles like the one so true<br />
To Uri's pleadings; still they kept their faith<br />
And reared their shapely mounds to meet the sun<br />
With his first glance, and from the morning's breath<br />
Retain their fervency, till day was done.<br />
From out their number, some were set apart<br />
For game and chase. The buffalo and deer<br />
And wild fowl, all, paid tribute to their skill,<br />
And vale and forest echoed with their cheer.<br />
<br />
But one of these, young Wabun, shunned the group,<br />
And wandered by the forest streams alone.<br />
Some called him "dreamer"; others tried to win<br />
His mooding back to mirth; but there was none<br />
That seemed to reach the center of his soul;<br />
He joined not in the worship of his race,<br />
And seemed to be so distant in his thought,<br />
That one might search the Pleiad's in his face.<br />
<br />
There shone a star upon the eastern rim&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">So suddenly it shot upon their view,</span><br />
So brilliant and so placid, never dim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through storm and starlight, always lit anew.</span><br />
They marveled much, and some were sore dismayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To seek the portents of this stranger star;</span><br />
But not so, Wabun; he, all unafraid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hailed it as answer from the dim afar,</span><br />
And showed unwonted pleasure at its sight;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His distance seemed to shorten, and his mind</span><br />
Seemed mellowed by a new-born love to man&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A quickened tenderness to help his kind.</span><br />
<br />
"I wander in the forest; by the stream";<br />
(They gave earnest audience as he spake)<br />
"And underneath the stars&mdash;and they all tell<br />
The story of a great, forgotten God.<br />
I listen to the murmuring of the rain,<br />
And to the mighty thunder of the clouds;<br />
And see the forked lightning, in its gleam,<br />
Strike the great oak to shivers, in its path;<br />
I see the maize upon a thousand fields;<br />
I see the goodly carpet on the earth&mdash;<br />
And every grassy thread a miracle&mdash;<br />
I see the sun upon his track of light,<br />
The moon upon her pathway in the sky&mdash;<br />
And all do tell of this forgotten God.<br />
For God is of the living, not the dead:<br />
The tree, the sun, the moon, the stars, and all,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>All fill their places; but are not alive<br />
<br />
"As we, with thought, and purpose, and design;<br />
But each doth turn upon a steady crank<br />
Held by a mighty and imperious hand.<br />
The bison, and the deer, and all the birds,<br />
Have life, and voice, and action, such as we;<br />
And yet they have no thought, except to live.<br />
They build no houses, lay no harvests up&mdash;<br />
We are their masters, with the right to kill.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"All things pay tribute to our prowent hands;</span><br />
All things we see are provident of us:<br />
The sun to ripen, and the moon to watch,<br />
The birds and flocks for us to gather flesh,<br />
The forests and the prairies for our use,<br />
The mines for metal, and the streams for fish&mdash;<br />
All, all, pay tribute to our wasting hands.<br />
Yet we are not a law unto ourselves:<br />
Though masters, yet not gods, for we all die<br />
And fall back into dust; yet are we great,<br />
And greatest of earth's creatures; but for death,<br />
We might claim highest unction; but our power<br />
Is limited; wherefore, if we are highest type<br />
Of creature earth, then must it surely be<br />
That God is man, but of a higher mold;<br />
Not subject unto death, but Lord of life.<br />
And, if all earthly forces must conserve<br />
Our being (highest born of all the earth),<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>Then back of us the great Creator stands<br />
<br />
"Unseen, as is Eternity unseen,<br />
But felt, as is each ripple of her waves,<br />
Upon the shores of our unstable life.<br />
The greater is not seen. We do not see<br />
The very thought that holds us in control.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thus have I doled, and pondered on it well,</span><br />
Until, upon my vision dawned that star;<br />
And as upon some errand quickly sent<br />
(I know not how I went, I felt so light),<br />
I sped upon its rays, o'er vale, and hill,<br />
And o'er a vaster water than the lakes&mdash;<br />
A grand expanse of green and surging waves.<br />
And, on, still on, till just before my face<br />
A mother, and an infant at her breast,<br />
And many seeming wise and stately men<br />
Bending in homage and with offerings choice,<br />
Of sweetly-scented vintage; then I sought<br />
To find the wherefore of this sweet emprize;<br />
And I was told this was the Son of God&mdash;<br />
The One that was to come, the mighty One,<br />
Redeemer of the world; that man had sinned<br />
And he was come to set at one the race<br />
With the All-Father; that we had been made<br />
In God's own image; that the sun and moon<br />
Were but his handiwork. To Him alone<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>(Invisible, yet always looking on)<br />
<br />
"Should homage be ascribed. All this was short<br />
Yet was it printed on my pliant breast,<br />
And cannot be erased. I seek no name<br />
And claim no higher homage for the gleam<br />
Vouchsafed my vision of the mighty past<br />
And prescience of the future; tis enough<br />
To know my steps directed, and to feel<br />
That in my darkness I have found out God.<br />
No more the unknown God, but evermore<br />
The ripened type of the diviner man;<br />
And as we reap the tokens of his love,<br />
Remember him as Father Man of men&mdash;<br />
The Infinite Perfection of our race."<br />
<br />
Much more he said which made a deep impress<br />
Upon the hardy hunters, and the less<br />
Were those who gave no sanction to his word;<br />
The greater portion followed him in thought,<br />
And soon in deed. The votaries of the sun<br />
Made most malignant onslaught, and they sought<br />
To drive the thoughtful Wabun from his "dream."<br />
The strife was vain. They in their fervent hope<br />
Turn to the East, into the wilderness&mdash;<br />
The grand Druidic of the Eastern slope,<br />
And, hid to all but God, they penetrate<br />
The deep <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'recessess'">recesses</ins>  of their broad estate.<br />
<br />
The gentle Wabun held for many years<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>His hand upon the pulses of their thought;<br />
Sometimes upon their love, sometimes their fears,<br />
His fervent purity, its impress wrought.<br />
He led them to the thousand untold charms<br />
That sparkle on the rugged Eastern slope.<br />
He bared to them the great Creator's arms,<br />
And, in God's grandest alphabet, he read their highest hope.<br />
<br />
Niagara was but a giant scroll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereon God writ a token of his strength;</span><br />
The muttering voice of its unceasing roll<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was but a cadence of the mighty length</span><br />
That measures the eternities of life.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its grandeur but one glitter of the gold</span><br />
That played upon his vesture; that the strife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of waters was the stream so cold,</span><br />
Down which humanity as rudely rushed;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without a thought for their eternal good,</span><br />
With all the semblance of the Father crushed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They pass down in the surge of death's unceasing flood.</span><br />
<br />
The broad Atlantic lashing at the shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was human passion&mdash;with the balance gone;</span><br />
Endeafening the graces with its roar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blindly lashing the Eternal throne.</span><br />
Into these miniatures, God thrust himself,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That every wave might glitter with his name,</span><br />
That every rock might hold upon its shelf<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some semblance that their reverence might claim.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The kindlier tokens of paternal care,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On Nature's face, were beaming everywhere.</span><br />
<br />
And yet, how few of us, can truly blend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The creature with Creator, in our sight;</span><br />
And from the Father, grasp the hand of friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose stars of providence outshine the night!</span><br />
Our eyes are fettered with an earthly bound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our narrow horizon will not enlarge;</span><br />
Our gaze, star fixed, will drop back to the ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And will not with the infinite surcharge.</span><br />
Only God's hand can push the barriers back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And give our vision unimpeded range;</span><br />
And with each respite, on the weary track,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fix the unchangeable, where all is change.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='title'>RETURN AND STRIFE.</div>

<div class='poem'>
No wonder, that when Wabun passed away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their torpid natures should have lost the charm</span><br />
That held so perfect, with its gentle sway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet slacked so quickly, with the palsied arm.</span><br />
Infirmities are easy to impart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And through the generations, they come down;</span><br />
But God must place his hand upon each heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And press each brow where he would drop a crown.</span><br />
<br />
Long brotherhood of forest, storm and flood,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had schooled them for the turbulence of life.</span><br />
The wraith of Nature made them men of blood;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The war of elements, the ocean's strife,</span><br />
The thunder of Niagara now heard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lashing of Atlantic on the beach,</span><br />
The slogan of the forest&mdash;in a word<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The carnival, at rife, within their reach,</span><br />
All served to spur their natures into storm.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How many catch the key-note of their song</span><br />
From the surrounding elements, and warm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their frozen energies, and make them strong</span><br />
In earth's unceasing alchemy! Much more<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The untutored savage; he has lost the key,</span><br />
And must from Nature's chalice find the door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through which to penetrate life's mystery.</span><br />
<br />
And many generations passed away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since these stern foresters had dwelt apart</span><br />
From their ancestral brethren; till the day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in their higher prowess, from the heart</span><br />
Of the great forest fastnesses, they spring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As panthers, on their unsuspecting prey.</span><br />
They have grown strong in weaponry, yet cling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Deity, in their untutored way.</span><br />
The "happy hunting ground" to them is Heaven;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the "Great Spirit" still to them is God;</span><br />
Yet, from their hearts, all tender passions driven,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">They smite their brethren with a heavy rod.</span><br />
A long and ceaseless struggle, many years,<br />
Alternately, invasion and defense,<br />
Till they are driven southward; and the fears,<br />
That Kohen's prophecy would be fullfilled<br />
And back of this, the agony intense<br />
Of impotence in prayer so deeply chilled<br />
The hearts of these poor children of the sun,<br />
That they gave easy conquest to their foes;<br />
And thus the struggle stubbornly begun,<br />
So unresisting now, was finished without blows.<br />
<br />
When man is shorn of strength, and there is left<br />
Only <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ominpotence'">Omnipotence</ins> , we kiss the rod&mdash;<br />
The very rod that smites us. In the cleft<br />
We would attempt to hide from Deity,<br />
Yet in his anger is an answered prayer&mdash;<br />
The consciousness of presence; though we flee,<br />
The wrath of love, is proof of constant care.<br />
But when we beat against the empty air,<br />
And every echo sends us back <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'dispair'">despair</ins> ,<br />
And even superstition, fails to foil<br />
Our souls with the deceptive glow of spoil,<br />
Then are we bittered, and our path made black;<br />
We grope in mists, Cimmerian, on the wrack<br />
Of constant and interminable doubt,<br />
A natural prey, and easy put to rout.<br />
<br />
To South, and West, they turn their fateful way<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>Beyond the Mississippi; and their day<br />
Seemed lighted with a new influx of hope.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sun embraced them with a warmer smile;</span><br />
The mellow fragrance of the Southern slope<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Added entrancement each succeeding mile.</span><br />
Not all at once the exodus took place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they were many, and had scattered wide;</span><br />
Yet to the southward all had set their face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To seek in other fields a place to hide</span><br />
From cruel persecutions. When our kin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lends its consanguined arder to the dart,</span><br />
How more intent, with vengeful purposes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How heavier is the load upon the heart!</span><br />
<br />
They scatter into fragmentary clans,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the earnest of their added woe,</span><br />
Give birth to new religious phantasies.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The unclogged streams of superstition flow,</span><br />
When down the mountains, and across the moors,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The heavy, swollen torrents sweep along,</span><br />
Throwing their scattered wrecks upon the shores,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And breaking barriers, however strong.</span><br />
Baal was great, when Baalbec reared her crest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And column after column gave her grace</span><br />
And all the East upon her beauty smiled;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when the "owls and bats" usurped her place,</span><br />
The god had fallen. In the temple dust,<br />
Where man, with his immortal, had so strove<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>To make the marble animate (in vain,<br />
Like other myriad phantoms of the brain)<br />
Time fashions into ghostly hands, that sternly point above.<br />
And so, God reaps involuntary praise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From every fashioning of man's design;</span><br />
His ways, indeed, cannot be called our ways;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet his hozannas, from each crumbling shrine,</span><br />
Teach us the servitude of all the past;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That human hands but fashion Heavenly aids;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That every sculptured mythmark only fades</span><br />
Into eternal sunshine, at the last.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some crossed the mountain ramparts of the West;</span><br />
Some lingered still upon the Eastern slope;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The empire yet was open to their zest,</span><br />
And all were buoyant with a new-born hope.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But war, like pestilence, doth warp our lives,</span><br />
And like contagion, it infects the air.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peace comes in measure, but it never thrives</span><br />
Directly after conflict, till grows fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flesh so lately scarred. Intestine war</span><br />
Made ravage of their ranks; they ill could spare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their bravest, yet the first to fall in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fraticidal'">fratricidal</ins> jar.</span><br />
The lines, by conflict, soon were closely drawn,<br />
And from the night of struggle nations dawn,<br />
Whose chiefs assume the King's prerogative.<br />
Clans fall, and clansmen perish; nations live<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>That pass chaotic conflict, and ensphere<br />
Their crude material, as a new-born world,<br />
To individual phalanxes, and rear<br />
Their rude escutcheon. As in ether whirled,<br />
The new born planet tracks its trial course;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So must this human query find its way,</span><br />
And failure is its fashion; but still worse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are those who fail to grapple with the day,</span><br />
But look supinely on while vested rights<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are trampled under foot, and raise no hand</span><br />
In deprecating gesture; from the heights<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of grim impartial history will stand</span><br />
Unfading letters, written to the shame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of those whose scourges fail to make a name.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='title'>PREHISTORIC RENDEZVOUS OF THE AZTECS.</div>

<div class='poem'>
On either side the crest of the Madre,<br />
Where mountains kiss their hands to either sea,<br />
One slope to blush upon the opening day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The other, to drop down its tapestry</span><br />
And hold the hand for promise of return,<br />
Three nations, as three stars, to being burn.<br />
The Toltecs, purest of the primal race,<br />
The Chichamecs, devoted to the chase,<br />
And Aztecs, strongest in the arts of war&mdash;<br />
All, seeming thrown beneath one fateful star.<br />
No painter limnes upon his labored scroll,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be it fantastic, feast, or forest shades,</span><br />
As war upon its victims; from the soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Plastic as new damped clay) it never fades</span><br />
Till Time has ironed out the furrowed past;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Peace, by laying fevered brows to rest,</span><br />
Over the present has its mantle cast;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Nature folds its wardling to its breast.</span><br />
So on these nations had been writ, in brief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The deep-burned liturgy of hardened strife,</span><br />
And through the furnace of their pungent grief,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They learn to plant the rootlets of their life.</span><br />
One thing is never lacking, at the time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in their nascent passions, nations rise:</span><br />
The craft of Priests, in every age and clime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To "point a moral," or portend the skies.</span><br />
And so, from cast-off altars to the sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New pleadings to new conjured gods arose;</span><br />
The selfish passions since the world begun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All seek supernal outlet on their foes.</span><br />
<br />
One thing, not far from truth, grew into form:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thought of one great, universal heart,</span><br />
That beat against the window pane of thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And formed of all existences a part.</span><br />
How near the passions of mankind will verge,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sometimes, upon the borderland of bliss!</span><br />
And all the race is bettered if they urge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Continuous march; nor turn their steps amiss;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>A little light would lead them on to God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lacking, it the race for ages plod.</span><br />
O that the infant eye of every race<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might recognize at once the Master's face!</span><br />
All brought their <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tribue'">tribute</ins> to Tonatiuh's shrine,<br />
Still burnishing the sun with rays divine.<br />
True worship strengthens in the wake of years;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Its song grows rhythmal with repeated chant;</span><br />
Its beauty lingers, though it disappears;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Rekindle, and it melts the adamant.</span><br />
But worship on a purely human base,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Though it may work its legends into song</span><br />
And deify the noblest of its race,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Can never be unquestionably strong.</span><br />
The happenings of Nature clog its wheels;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The elements brush down its cobweb foils;</span><br />
And from its mimicry the heart appeals,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And heavenly souls are not for human toils.</span><br />
It is impossible to still the brain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By merely human fiat at it thrust;</span><br />
Man journeys out, and he returns again&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Father's voice alone can call him from the dust.</span><br />
<br />
And yet, each effort of the human soul,<br />
To force existence for its latent wings,<br />
Is of an energy that leaps control,<br />
Whose germ from our immortal nature springs.<br />
The very latch-key of the eternal realm,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Though touched in ignorance, commands the door.<br />
A more than human wisdom guides the helm,<br />
As we approach the palm-extending shore.<br />
The hungry arms that reach out after God,<br />
Are as the infants for the parent's breast;<br />
The soul is weary of its fruitless plod,<br />
And Nature beckons it to perfect rest.<br />
What though the stream be poisoned, if its flow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seeks only the great ocean to be lost;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not long upon its bosom is it tossed,</span><br />
Ere it recovers its old healthful glow.<br />
The old-time sparkle of the mountain spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gleams in the dew-drop that returns to earth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No poison lurks within the second birth,</span><br />
It ever carries healing on its wing.<br />
Thus, howsoe'er the soul may find its way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the wilderness to Jordan's plain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It shall not fail of its eternal gain,</span><br />
The night so trackless shall break into day.<br />
The saint, whom angels ushered through the gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With p&aelig;ans of rejoicing, once did grope</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lose his way, and loose his hold on hope&mdash;</span><br />
No soul that reaches it is told to wait.<br />
God waits upon the effort to reply,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seeing human hands stretch out for aid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His stronger palm is soon upon them laid&mdash;</span><br />
Our weakness is the signet he cannot deny.<br />

<div class='title'>THE TOLTECS JOURNEY SOUTH.</div>

<div class='poem'>
The Toltecs were the first to break the way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toward the vertex of the Summer sun;</span><br />
To catch the fervor of his ripest ray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And talismise the pilgrimage begun.</span><br />
And after many days their fasting eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are feasted with Mexitli's<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> lovely plain&mdash;</span><br />
So like a newly-fashioned paradise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An almost Eden, sprung to life again.</span><br />
Her placid lakes gave back her deep blue sky<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In rivalry of Nature&mdash;Nature's charms</span><br />
Do cast reflected multiples, and try<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fold us in with her unnumbered arms.</span><br />
Not all we see, but all we feel, invites,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Together with our seeing, to secure</span><br />
An unrestricted homage; all unite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this uncovered world, so rich and pure</span><br />
And lade with sunshine, ripened into form,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Concentered rays to leaves and blossoms grown,</span><br />
The larch impendent with its verdant cone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The oak's historic battlement of storm,</span><br />
The cypress mourning and exultant palms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The provident maguey, whose offered alms</span><br />
Found ready acceptation at their hands,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The maize, which they had known in northern lands,</span><br />
Were native to her rich and virgin soil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave the husbandman unstinted spoil.</span><br />

<div class='poem'>
And thus, with Nature and themselves at rest,<br />
Fresh inspiration from the God of peace<br />
Expands and energizes every breast,<br />
And fettered manhood labors for release.<br />
Invention is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'emanciapation'">emancipation</ins> : Time<br />
Doth loosen Nature's fetters; man invents<br />
Not one of those discoveries sublime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That couples his poor name with consequence.</span><br />
The world had moved a million years or so<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere Galileo blundered into prison</span><br />
For telling how we are compelled to go.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fog of superstition had not risen;</span><br />
And he whose brain peered up above the cloud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To widen the horizon of his thought,</span><br />
Must be content to leave the gnarlish crowd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of puppets and of priestcraft who have fought</span><br />
The van of progress, immemorial time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In fear some newly loosened truth might break</span><br />
Some preconcerted dogma, deeming crime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The impulsive movement of the soul to slake</span><br />
The thirst that God implanted there, to burn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its way into the hidden and unseen,</span><br />
And find new thoroughfares for its return,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on creation's outer verge new entities to glean.</span><br />
So did these primal pioneers look out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the compass of their husbandry,</span><br />
And challenge their surroundings; manly, stout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And earnest did they seek the mystic tree</span><br />
Of knowledge in this Eden of the West,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not interdicted by Divine decree,</span><br />
But always open to the manly quest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the unflagging purpose to be free.</span><br />
The zodiac gave up its lettered scroll<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To their inquiries; and the measured year</span><br />
Unsealed the clasp that held it from control,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And truths that had seemed very far, revealed themselves quite near.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Their rudely fashioned lodges soon gave way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To buildings of a more pretentious form;</span><br />
The forests and the quarries and the clay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were forced to human vassalage. The charm</span><br />
That held the forest templary from spoil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was not entirely broken; after years</span><br />
And Christian conquest must consume the toil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And travail of the centuries. Our tears,</span><br />
Are but a poor atonement for the brand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our westward march has made on Nature's back.</span><br />
We mourn our forest fastnesses too late;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With hand unbridled we have torn their face,</span><br />
And given legal sanction to their fate&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">But what companionship can take their place?</span><br />
Nearest to Nature's very heart of hearts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The verdant monarchs beckon us to God;</span><br />
Their benison with life alone departs;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They testify of Eden from the sod.</span><br />
O man! that thy perfection should be lost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When so much <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'pefectness'">perfectness</ins> is left on earth!</span><br />
How much of bitterness! With what a cost<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Didst thou forget the sacred touch that hallowed thee at birth!</span><br />
<br />
The worship of Hurakin, "Heart of Heaven,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spoke of a healthier, higher growth of soul,</span><br />
The consciousness of sins to be forgiven;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A god, whom weakness could at once control;</span><br />
A prophecy, of Fatherhood to come;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A ray that pencils from the "great white throne;"</span><br />
A voice to energies, that had been dumb<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For many centuries&mdash;prophetic groan</span><br />
Of man's insatiate thirst for betterment,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not all in vain. The white-winged dove of peace</span><br />
For many years was theirs; they came and went<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond their borders, without let or lease;</span><br />
Found sunnier climes to South; and, as a charm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was laid upon their footsteps, they advance</span><br />
To hover closer to their ancient god.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They still were pliant to his fateful glance,</span><br />
And scanned his burnished surface to inquire<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">His potency in human destiny.</span><br />
They had forgot the legend of his fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, from his searching, steadfast eye, not one of them were free.</span><br />
<br />
So pass they out from the historic ken&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Theirs, no aggressive way-mark on the earth.</span><br />
We linger on their passage, and the pen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would gladly pour regret upon the dearth</span><br />
Of the indentures they have left to mark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their peaceful, noiseless tread upon the shore;</span><br />
But it is vain; yet out of all this dark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One lesson may we glean: That evermore</span><br />
The souls that move with nature on her march<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are those who drop, as she drops down her leaves;</span><br />
They fill the earth with fruitfulness, and arch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The highway of the nations with their sheaves;</span><br />
They sleep to history, but wake to God;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Theirs is the pass-key through eternal gates;</span><br />
They write no vengeful Sanscrit on the sod;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They linger at no earthly court, but the recording seraph waits</span><br />
To write them blessed of the Lord, the jewels of the fates.<br />

<div class='title'>THE AZTECS&mdash;AZTLAN.</div>

<div class='poem'>
The silver current of the upper Grande,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And where the Gila penetrates the East,</span><br />
The Zuni lines its rocky bed with sand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New ground from granite that has been released</span><br />
From mountain base. The vertebrate Madre<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breaks into several center-stays of spine,</span><br />
Which form the watershed that feeds the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On either side the sunny slopes recline.</span><br />
Where Coronado laid in after years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The scepter of his Sovereign, and bespoke</span><br />
The unbroke silence, as the cycle nears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bending of the neck to Hispagniola's yoke.</span><br />
<br />
Here was the fabled Aztlan; and the race,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose ancestry had circled half the globe,</span><br />
Have now their latest destiny to face.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O! could they peer the darkness through, and probe</span><br />
The deep recesses of impending time!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look for one moment on what was to be!</span><br />
How would they cling to this rude mountain clime,<br />
And bar the door of their futurity!<br />
<br />
The Aztecs were a proud and prowent race;<br />
In the dispersal at the far Northeast,<br />
Now many years, they held the leading place;<br />
Yet, in their husbandry, they were the least.<br />
Their hands were skilled to turbulence and strife;<br />
The bow, the lance, and the rude hunter's knife&mdash;<br />
Such were their ready implements; but peace<br />
Found them all unacquainted; her surcease<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>Requires a range of weaponry diverse.<br />
The hands that hew down others, lips that curse,<br />
Both must be newly christened; and the arts<br />
That unify the race with nature's ways<br />
Must hard their hands and reimburse their hearts,<br />
And time their lips with sunnier kinds of lays.<br />
<br />
As if to fill the interim, there grew<br />
From their own ranks, the fittest kind of guide,<br />
A pastoral leader; who by instinct knew<br />
The flowery paths that lead on either side<br />
The verdant fields of husbandry and thrift;<br />
The worthy Moctheuzoma<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> had this gift,<br />
And led them to the conquest of the soil&mdash;<br />
That easy conquering that seeks its spoil<br />
Only where God intended it for man,<br />
The fruits of his own labor. Thus began<br />
An era of self-discipline, that led<br />
The Aztecs on to greatness; and that shed<br />
A tender halo over after years,<br />
When memory will mingle with our tears.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
He turned their eyes upon the talcite ledge,<br />
And said: "Behold, this is Tonatuah's pledge<br />
Of providence against the Summer's heat<br />
And the cold frosts of Winter; quarry it,<br />
And fashion it for framework to your homes.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>For centuries it has withstood the storm,<br />
"To wait upon your coming; let your feet<br />
Be busy with its treasures." Then he turned<br />
To where the clay, for years, had been inurned,<br />
And said: "Make use of this; 'tis Thaloc's<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> gift.<br />
The mighty thunderer hath torn it down,<br />
And ground it into ashes, for your use;<br />
Mold it in shapely fragments, and the sun,<br />
The warm-faced Tonatuah, will pour out<br />
His warmest rays to bake it back to stone.<br />
And more, this pliant clay has aptitudes<br />
For vessels of all kinds, and yours are rude;<br />
So in a hundred ways you may improve."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, pointing to the forest, thus he spoke:</span><br />
"There Tonatu' and Thaloc both did shake<br />
Their well-filled branches to the earth for us,<br />
That we might gather fruit, for any taste.<br />
These noble trees have swelled the turf for years,<br />
And now will bend the neck for our support.<br />
We must be provident; for they do point<br />
Their myriad fingers to the hands that gave,<br />
Mute monitors, to beckon us of Heaven.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
"The fish and fowl, and all the vast menage<br />
That track our mountain slopes, are all our own.<br />
But look out on the earth, whose grassy turf<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Lifts up its thousand homages to Heaven;<br />
"Whence must we gather fruit of our own toil.<br />
The maize will grow if planted; the legume<br />
Will ripen; and our hands will surely fill,<br />
If we but ask the earth and gods to help<br />
And second our endeavors. We must work.<br />
The river, from the mountain, rushes on;<br />
The mountain shakes its thousand plumes at her;<br />
The stars do not keep quiet in the skies;<br />
All nature is alert and on the watch;<br />
And man must bear his burden at the mill."<br />
<br />
Thus, did he lead them to their better selves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ravel out the intricates of life</span><br />
In wisdom's stern and simple litany;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gave trenchent lessons to the man and wife,</span><br />
And scattered homes upon new harvest fields.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he, who sets a household altar up,</span><br />
And sanctifies it with the name of home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fresh sprinkled from the sacred nuptial cup,</span><br />
Is Heaven's Ambassador in human form.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hearthstone is the herald of advance;</span><br />
The hanging of each homely crane, like one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of God's unnumbered irridescent plants,</span><br />
Sheds rainbow hues on all it shines upon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And blessings bend each limb upon its tree.</span><br />
Thrice happy is the nation thus begun,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For it has found the track of destiny.</span><br />
The mines he opened, and laid bare the beds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of precious minerals that underlie</span><br />
The bases of our mountain chains.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For all our wants, we have a full supply,"</span><br />
Thus spake the seer. "We shall not beat in vain<br />
Against the bars that keep our souls from flight.<br />
Our birth is built around by providence;<br />
Our wants are wickets to unmeasured wealth.<br />
If we but find the turnstile to the field,<br />
We have but half the hill of life to climb;<br />
The other half fades out as we advance;<br />
When we have toiled out half-way distance up,<br />
Lo! we have found the summit, and descend.<br />
<br />
"Thus do we work together with the gods;<br />
If we but do our best, it is enough;<br />
When we put out our arms, they reach to us,<br />
Though they do span the universe, to meet<br />
And draw us up, the shining heights of life.<br />
So in our daily plodding; if we sow,<br />
The gods will furnish harvest; if we build,<br />
The gods have made the quarry and the clay;<br />
Whatever purposes we have in life,<br />
If they be only for our betterment,<br />
The crude material is at our hands;<br />
We only fashion it to suit our wants;<br />
Nor is the measure stinted to our needs,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>But all our vessels fill to overflow<br />
"Look over the green fields! Great is our want,<br />
But greater the supply; on every hand<br />
The wild flowers lift their heads, and what are these<br />
But kisses thrown from Heaven to win us back?<br />
Our appetites are but our weaker parts,<br />
And easy satisfied; not so our souls;<br />
They have external longings to supply;<br />
And all that beautifies and brightens earth<br />
Are forecasts of a kingdom yet to come.<br />
As on earth's surface may be found the flowers,<br />
So, underneath the shining metals are<br />
The surplus of a generous providence.<br />
Our fathers, on the borders of the lakes,<br />
Did fashion implements of husbandry<br />
From inexhaustive mines; but here we have<br />
In lesser quantities, much brighter ores,<br />
Fit mostly for adornment and exchange.<br />
<br />
"Man is not satisfied with 'hand to mouth.'<br />
The beasts roam through the forests and are filled,<br />
And therewith are content; not so with man.<br />
Two worlds break on his vision; and the one<br />
Must interlock the other in his life,<br />
Or he goes blindly out into the night.<br />
And it is well earth gives no perfect rest,<br />
Or the hereafter would fall out of sight.<br />
Man is the one ambitious animal<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Who seeks for empire, as the brute seeks food;<br />
The tame necessities are not enough,<br />
But all the precious under flowers of earth<br />
Must fill the measure of his discontent.<br />
All men are not alike, and some must hold<br />
The fullest measure of life's luxuries;<br />
These pay their surplus for the others' toil;<br />
With them the shining metals will be held<br />
As medium for barter and for trade.<br />
And as Earth decks her bosom with the flowers,<br />
So will the human race adorn themselves<br />
And blossom out with variance of gems."<br />
<br />
Though, still encumbered with their ancient myths,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He pointed out the harmony of Heaven;</span><br />
Gave why and wherefore to the dread eclipse.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not his to tell them how the earth is driven</span><br />
Upon its swinging orbit over space;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet he measured out the perfect year;</span><br />
He looked stern Nature bravely in the face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seemed to question her without a fear.</span><br />
Transcendent genius; thus to grapple Truth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across the path still covered from his sight,</span><br />
Yet is she merciful; her name is Ruth;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She never perches on so grand a height,</span><br />
But she will answer to her children's call,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spread her wings to fly to their embrace&mdash;</span><br />
This link was never broken by our fall,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And writes Evangel on our troubled race.</span><br />
With his own hand he led them to the field,<br />
With his own hand he taught them how to build;<br />
He showed them what true husbandry would yield,<br />
How all their empty measures could be filled<br />
By wakeful industry. "Well pointed toil<br />
Is touchstone to earth's treasure-box," said he.<br />
"Our fathers may enrich us with their spoil,<br />
And we may thus evade the beaten path;<br />
Yet, lying dormant on our fathers' beds,<br />
Our waste brings want upon our children's heads.<br />
Far better that each hand be labor-marked,<br />
That all may know the purchase of their lives;<br />
He loses half the journey who goes out<br />
To the incertitudes of other worlds,<br />
Who has not tasted what his hands have won<br />
On this, his trial sphere."<br />
<br />
Thus in well-chosen words, and earnest deeds,<br />
He planted fruit that crowded out the weeds.<br />
Ruled by divinest right of master-mind,<br />
By wisdom and humility combined,<br />
By heart, as well as head and hand, he wrought;<br />
For there be many who can ne'er be taught<br />
By any else than throbbing 'gainst their own,<br />
Of some great royal heart; this is their throne;<br />
And he who sways in scepterhood of love,<br />
Gets his vicegerent from the throne above.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>Through many years did Moctheuzoma reign;<br />
And Aztlan prospered, and the race grew strong;<br />
And when his body passed to earth again,<br />
His spirit, with its wisdom, lingered long.<br />
<br />
Thus, with a twilight halo pass the great<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Across the threshold with a noiseless tread;</span><br />
We linger but a moment at the gate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To pay our homage to the honored dead;</span><br />
Then turn to find them still inurned with us.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their silence is more eloquent than words,</span><br />
Their passing out is but life's overplus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their tongues are tempered into two-edged swords.</span><br />
They speak across the chasm of their graves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In weightier words, in thoughts far more intense;</span><br />
In life they mingled with its thousand waves&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is God's way; death ripens eloquence.</span><br />
<br />
Time trolls along with its unceasing march,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Aztlan has outgrown her former bounds;</span><br />
She holds the center of the ancient arch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the historic ladder's highest rounds.</span><br />
She sways the queenly scepter of the past<br />
Above the waymarks of a hundred realms;<br />
Yet leaves but hints of the grand overcast,<br />
Through which she burns her way, and overwhelms<br />
Our thoughts with all the possibles of time.<br />
We can but poorly comprehend, yet write her most sublime.<br />

<div class='title'>THE AZTEC'S JOURNEY AND SETTLEMENT SOUTH.</div>

<div class='poem2'>
Another turn of fortune's fickle wheel.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They journey to the South, and cast their lot</span><br />
Upon Mexitli's lovely plain; the heel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of other nations has forestalled the spot,</span><br />
And they must win their way through turbulence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To reach the border of the placid lake,</span><br />
Where conquest waits their hardly purchased chance;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all of Anahuac shall feel the shake</span><br />
Of their unconquered tread. Not many years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere nation follows nation to their thrall;</span><br />
And many are the hot, convulsive tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through which we read of any people's fall.</span><br />
Our homes and hearthstones are so near the same,<br />
Or column-capped, or made of homely clay&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Marble and gold can make no higher claim</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than thatch or brushwood, so they bear the name</span><br />
Of household, hallowed for centuries or held but for a day.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>As if to track a thousand similes<br />
Of thorn and rose, of laughter and of tears,<br />
War strikes its hand upon all sacristies;<br />
(Religion must be bent to its decrees)<br />
Holding our destinies&mdash;our hopes and fears<br />
Are all within its baleful balance thrown.<br />
It beats upon the organ of our lives, and history repeats the wild, discordant moan.<br />
So nations, whose lost anchorage must pay<br />
The penalty of their forgetfulness,<br />
Seek out phantasmal deities to prey<br />
Upon their vitals in their sore distress.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mars, or Mexitli<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>: though the one be crowned</span><br />
With all the glory that bedecks old Rome,<br />
The idols of the other, fiercely ground<br />
To powdered pulp by Spain's invading host.<br />
How much of agony they both have cost<br />
Ask of the millions lost to life and home!<br />
Ambition makes a C&aelig;sar: it is well<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It gives some recompense for all its crime;</span><br />
For it has made the earth an endless hell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crowding its woes upon the lap of time&mdash;</span><br />
And yet, religion spurs it to the test,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And priests have been the primates of its throne,</span><br />
Chanting their auguries to fire its breast,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Braying all history with their undertone.</span><br />
Nor is the "manger," with its cradled Christ,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Free from the misinterpreting of Priest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cross where God and man have kept their tryst,</span><br />
Been changed to leaven for inglorious feast&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God! must future draw its cadence from the past,</span><br />
And plow its furrow through the same red mould?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must nations be in the same furnace cast,</span><br />
And man, the master, bought, and scourged, and sold?<br />
Then is creation but a lie accursed,<br />
And better that the doom upon it burst.<br />
No. Though experience may slowly turn,<br />
And man may learn as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'slowy'">slowly</ins>, yet we learn.<br />
The risen Christ did break the grasp of death,<br />
And empire, dead in trespasses, will yet receive its breath.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem2'><br />
Aztlan must pass through all the fated field<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of mythologic peculence and lore,</span><br />
And to their sturdy priestcraft blindly yield,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cipher out the destinies in store.</span><br />
They must propitiate the gods with blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Especially their war-god must be fed,</span><br />
And to supply their deities with food<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their fated subjects must be freely bled.</span><br />
So superstition whets the fatal blade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which culminates in human sacrifice.</span><br />
The maw of Huitzilopotchli<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> must be stayed,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And altars with their thousand victims rise.</span><br />
Sad proof of imperfection in the race,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay, more, the very demon in the breast;</span><br />
Their ignorance alone is plea for grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When in their filthiness they stand confessed.</span><br />
"Ye must be born again," the Savior said;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And history, through time, has craved this birth.</span><br />
Man and his Maker must indeed be wed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we would bring redemption to the earth.</span><br />
The empty riddle of the crucifix,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shallow rattle of the Christian creeds,</span><br />
Will leaven nothing if we fail to mix<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ripened grain of soul-inspiring deeds.</span><br />
The past accuses us with bony hands;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We cannot shun its cold and cruel eyes;</span><br />
The glass is turning with our future sands&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We face eternal destinies. God grant we be more wise!</span><br />

<div class='title'>THE EMPIRE OF MONTEZUMA.</div>

<div class='poem'>
The Star looked down at the Mountain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Mountain looked down at the Sea;</span><br />
And there was no malice in either one's breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each was called by the Deity</span><br />
To fill its place in the region of space<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the fathomless Yet-to-be.</span><br />
The Star didn't fall on the Mountain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor the Mountain smite the sea;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>But each gave cheer in the other's ear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they dwelt in harmony.</span><br />
Why didn't the Mountain say to the Star:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Begone, with your impudent stare!"</span><br />
Or the Sea to the Mountain: "How dare you intrude,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You presumptuous imp of the air?"</span><br />
Why didn't they? they were not human;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They couldn't talk, as we talk;</span><br />
They were not born of a woman;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They never had learned to walk.</span><br />
<br />
They had learned the language of patience;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They had learned to bear, and be dumb;</span><br />
They had learned to hold, through heat and cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their load, till the Master should come.</span><br />
O infinite language of silence!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O eloquent, voiceless speech!</span><br />
Help us to bear the ills that are,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fetter us each to each,</span><br />
Till all our envy goes out with the Sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our malice goes out with the star,</span><br />
And we silently bear what is to be&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the Mountain&mdash;gazing afar</span><br />
To the infinite depths of an endless world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where eternity spreads its zone,</span><br />
Where planets, countless as grains of sand,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gaze out on the "great white throne."</span><br />
The pale-faced prophet Quetzalcoatl<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had gone to the rising sun;</span><br />
In his wizard boat he was seen to float,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To where the day was begun,</span><br />
Without a sail on the wings of the gale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the land of Tlappalan<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></span><br />
He waved back his followers from the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saying he would certainly come again,</span><br />
In the golden future, yet to be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the gods should dwell on the earth as men.</span><br />
They had made him a god, because he was good&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not always the case in the mystic love&mdash;</span><br />
They had carved his image in stone and wood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his shrines were built on the pyramid's floor.</span><br />
They called him the god of the earth and air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his legends were many, and often told;</span><br />
And the priests, with sacrifice and prayer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reaped a heavy harvest of fruit and gold.</span><br />
And oft were their faces turned to the East,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To claim <i>his</i> promise, who <i>was</i> to come;</span><br />
And they watched the surge of the gulf's green yeast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet the years had continued dumb.</span><br />

Nezahualcoyotl sleeps with his fathers,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his son now reigns in his stead;</span><br />
His <i>goodness</i> succeeds to the living,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But his <i>wisdom</i> goes out with the dead,</span><br />
For both in the Lord of Tezcuco<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had been richly and happily wed.</span><br />
Two nations, strike hands o'er the waters,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tezcuco and Aztlan are one,</span><br />
By the league that their fathers had plighted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since they entered this land of the sun.</span><br />
So, the King of their neighbor, Tezcuco,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has come to the Aztec Court,</span><br />
To assist them in crowning the Monarch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Prince of much goodly report.</span><br />
He is found on the steps of the temple;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He has served, both as warrior and Priest;</span><br />
He has brought many victims to slaughter&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The realm has been greatly increased</span><br />
By the sturdy sway of his conquering arm.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now, he is called to reign,</span><br />
The last of his race, to fill the place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose honor shall prove but a life-long pain.</span><br />
<br />
Montezuma<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> was young, but his sword was old,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>And the war-god was glutted with victims and gold.<br />
A pledge of his prowess: a promise to fate,<br />
That the nation would prosper, the King prove great.<br />
Some men are great in sorrow&mdash;there be tears<br />
That crystalize to diamonds at the last.<br />
They need the weight of carbonizing years;<br />
Yet, how they glitter after these have past!<br />
Life needs the tempering at such a forge,<br />
Or it would brittle at the lightest touch;<br />
But when the burden is but one vast gorge,<br />
The weary soul must cry, "It is too much."<br />

<div class='poem'>
Nezahualpilli<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> places the crown on his head,<br />

The words of admonishment all are said,<br />
And the buoyant crowd to their homes return.<br />
"The King is dead!" "Long live the King!"<br />
"Hail!" and "farewell!" how closely tread<br />
The steps of the living upon the dead!<br />
How are both touched with a single spring!<br />
Nezahualpilli soon passes away,<br />
And the rival King, he so lately crowned,<br />
Divides his Kingdom, and makes a prey,<br />
A figment, with empire's empty sound.<br />
And Montezuma outleaps the King;<br />
But is lord of an empire reaching the sea;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>And many nations their tribute bring,<br />
And some of the weak to the southward flee,<br />
To pass the reach of his powerful arm,<br />
And lift new prodigies to the sky,<br />
To meet Earth's sunshine, shadow, and storm,<br />
To finish the race, to falter and die.<br />

He gathers his treasures from myriad mines.<br />
The cotton and aloe are wove into cloth.<br />
The banana and maize and wild forest vines,<br />
While they load to repletion, are proof against sloth.<br />
His palace is burnished with every hue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the rainbow tints of his fabulous land,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Nature entravails on every hand</span><br />
To bring new beauties of life to view.<br />
There are drapes of feather-cloth deftly made,<br />
There were plumes and plushes of richest craft,<br />
There were broidered robes where the colors played,<br />
Like the hands that made them, dainty and daft.<br />
His harem equaled his Ottoman peer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was beauty of every hue and mold&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shy and the gay, the demure and bold&mdash;</span><br />
That his provinces furnished from far and near.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As fine a collection of beauty and grace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the flashing eye and the beaming face,</span><br />
As is seen on the gates of the Euxine sea<br />
At the present day, where the "powers that be,"<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And half a hundred gods their worship claim;</span><br />
Their priestcraft is a strong and haughty band;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their Beckets and their Woolseys are the same</span><br />
As those that cling upon the neck of time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through all the feudal ages; we may choose</span><br />
The leeches of the Christian Church as best&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sucked the blood the State could not refuse,</span><br />
And so did these bedizzened, of the West.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>These</i> led their victims to the altars black,</span><br />
<i>Those</i> wasted theirs by torturing and pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fatal "itztli," gave the parting shock</span><br />

Through all the dark of ages did they grope;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through all the light of empire did'st thou graze;</span><br />

<div class='poem'>
They had their courts where justice was dispensed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With what would shame the Janus-faced machine</span><br />
We call our jurisprudence. They commenced<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What Christian polity was left to glean,</span><br />
To her advantage in the after time.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We write "anathema" above the gates</span><br />
Of what we choose to call "barbaric clime;"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet, the blinded goddess often waits</span><br />
To gather wisdom at <i>her</i> bare, black feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which, bruised and blistered, tread the narrow way</span><br />
To where the graces uninspired meet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And superstition's night breaks into day.</span><br />
<br />
They held the bond of family and home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As firmly as more favored nations hold;</span><br />
Their homes were castles, where no man could come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without the potent ses-a-me of gold.</span><br />
The wealthy pluralized the name of wife<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">(As many Bible patriarchs once did),</span><br />
Their virtue was the average of life&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There were excrescences not easy hid.</span><br />
Yet woman was more near her half of earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than she had reached in most of Christendom.</span><br />
She held her value and could claim her worth;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not bartered with the readiness of some</span><br />
Self-styled enlightened. Much is to be learned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In corners of the earth that we call "dark,"</span><br />
Where jewels are for centuries inurned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That torches of enlightenment may tarnish with a spark.</span><br />
<br />
We lay rude hands on temples not our own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor little heed the human souls enshrined;</span><br />
The sacred crevice of each hard-marked stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But coldly cover with the virdict, "blind."</span><br />
God help us, that we point a hand more pure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And raise the casement with a grander trust;</span><br />
The hands that lift it must indeed be clean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or comes the humbling challenge, "Is it just?"</span><br />
One "great white throne" shall judge us, one and all;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One great white Hand shall hold the scales of fate,</span><br />
Or clothed in light, or covered with a pall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We tread the way through one eternal gate.</span><br />
God grant the temples we so rudely spoil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May not accuse us when we stand alone!</span><br />
But hearts are human things, and they do coil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The infinite in blindness. Not a groan</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>Escapes the index of the Father Son.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A child in blindness still is but a child,</span><br />
And held with greater yearning to be won.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our cold, hard hands cannot be reconciled</span><br />
To one warm Heart that throbs for all mankind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And covers, with a common love, the race;</span><br />
And leads, with greater tenderness, the blind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they more closely feel His clasp, who cannot see His face.</span><br />
<br />
The arts of husbandry were well advanced:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sowed and reaped unstinted from the soil;</span><br />
The sun, with ripening fervor, on them glanced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave them back, a hundred fold, their toil.</span><br />
They had not lost their ancient faith in him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though other gods their scattered homage claim</span><br />
His breast was their Elysian; never dim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ancient hope that hung upon his name.</span><br />
Their maize and maguey shone upon the plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their chocolate gave nourishment and zest,</span><br />
The corn gave recompense for sugar-cane,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their banquets were provided with the best;</span><br />
Fish from the ocean, fruits from every clime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So diverse, yet within such easy reach;</span><br />
The tropics and the temperates enchime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all their plumaged babblings of speech;</span><br />
And they interpreted the varied whims<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That Nature holds embryoed in her breast.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>They climbed the boughs and shook her heaviest limbs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too burdened for the garner to be missed.</span><br />
This ancient mother never yet has failed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her children in their earnest search for food;</span><br />
She may be panoplied and heavy mailed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet does her larder furnish all when fully understood.</span><br />
<br />
Take all in all, and measure by the test&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stern, hard test of history&mdash;and we find</span><br />
That Aztlan, very far from being best,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still was a prodigy. That she was blind</span><br />
In her religious ethics, none deny;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That she had faults, no champion gainsays;</span><br />
She lifted bloody hands against the sky;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She filled the avenging measure of her days.</span><br />
But God is God, and man is always man;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And earthly judgment is at best a snare.</span><br />
And never, since the human race began,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has turned to Heaven more piteous despair</span><br />
Than her sad eyes, burnt out with agony;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moaning above her nation, and her name,</span><br />
The bitter monody of "Not to be,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The deep humiliation, and the shame</span><br />
That sent her crouching at the foot of Spain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(The fairest daughter of the wilderness)</span><br />
Without a hand to solace in her pain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or ray of hope to lighten her distress.</span><br />
<br />
Could she been gently led, and tenderly,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To higher life and holier resolve,</span><br />
Had charity bent forth her noble sway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Christian graces that with Earth revolve</span><br />
Without the wasting friction, paid their suit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To win her back to wakefulness from sin&mdash;</span><br />
How would she compensate the victor's hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kiss the rod that smote with its regard!</span><br />
But to be "drawn and quartered" like the brute,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made the sport of passion; to begin</span><br />
A life of vassalage, with such a slave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yclept as master, claiming from above</span><br />
The license that Jehovah never gave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Except the iron hand was woven o'er with love&mdash;</span><br />
It is too much! God's justice is not lame.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hypocrisy may steal and wear the cloak,</span><br />
And don the ermine, with its fair, false claim;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With crucifix and litany may croak;</span><br />
But Time o'ertakes it and it falls to earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like Judas on its immolating sword,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it must learn to curse its hour of birth.</span><br />
It is the pledge of destiny&mdash;the stern, unwritten word.<br />

<div class='title'>THE LANDING OF THE SPANIARDS.</div>

<div class='poem'>
The Courier<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>, new laden from the coast,<br />
Has hastened to the council of the King<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>With most portentious tidings: picture-prints<br />
That tell of boats that float upon the wing;<br />
And pale-faced warriors, clad in shining scales.<br />
The monarch hears with trembling; he has long<br />
Looked for the coming of great Quetzalcoatl,<br />
And, though he felt his nation to be strong,<br />
Yet had he feared his reign would be the last.<br />
The oracles had read him overcast,<br />
With some impending destiny&mdash;the ruse<br />
Which priests have always found to compass their abuse.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
The chiefs of church and state are all convened<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To canvas, and compare their theories,</span><br />
And much of wisdom surely can be gleaned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From these firm-visaged counsellors of his;</span><br />
And Montezuma<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> is the first to speak&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His dark, sad eyes are beautifully bright;</span><br />
He was not philosophic like the Greek,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet his words made glitter of the night:</span><br />
<br />
"We swing upon the hinges of our fate,<br />
Most reverend priests and worthy counsellors,<br />
And it is well we counsel and conform<br />
Our future to the fashion of events.<br />
The rising sun has sent inquiring rays<br />
For many years, to greet our coming god,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>And lo! he now turns back from Tlapalan;<br />
"And what must we, but welcome his advance?<br />
Ye long have held me kindred of the gods;<br />
Yet I deny me what your partial eyes<br />
Have kenned upon my unassuming face.<br />
I am as other men, though more advanced;<br />
And if great <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Quetzalcoalt'">Quetzalcoatl</ins> takes back my crown,<br />
I bow in humble vassalage to him.<br />
For what am I, to question his advance?<br />
A moth, upon the torches' fervent ray;<br />
An anthill, at the foot of 'Catapetl.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
And I have sometimes thought most worthy priests,<br />
That we have drawn the lightning from the cloud<br />
By a mistaken worship of the gods.<br />
No one will question my religious zeal,<br />
For I brought many victims to the block;<br />
But human blood doth have a subtile voice<br />
That reaches ears our eyes have never seen;<br />
And though the itztli opens to the heart,<br />
Some heart may beat far out in open space<br />
That whispers its avengement on the air.<br />
Our gods have brought us victory, 'tis true;<br />
And yet, great <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Nezahualcoyolt'">Nezahualcoyotl</ins> did spurn<br />
The shedding of all human blood, to gods;<br />
And when great Quetzalcoatl was on the earth,<br />
Our gods were satisfied with other blood.<br />
The angels of the mighty past cry out<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>Against the damning practice. Why not now,<br />
"For once and all, wash off our bloody hands?<br />
These human cries pierce farther than we know;<br />
These human souls may ride into the sun;<br />
We cannot claim his broad, uncumbered breast,<br />
To the exclusion of the rest of earth.<br />
The god of earth and air may come to judge<br />
At this dark moment for this very sin;<br />
Then let us look him boldly in the face,<br />
And if we have offended, make amends;<br />
If our mistaken zeal has overdone,<br />
Surely his heart will cover up our faults,<br />
And we may thus propitiate his wrath."<br />
<br />
Then rose the ancient High Priest, Tlalocan,<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a><br />
And in his sternest manner, thus he spake:<br />
"Great Montezuma! king, of earthly kings!<br />
The heart of Tlalocan is bruised and broke<br />
To hear the words his monarch has vouchsafed<br />
Such sacrilege belongeth not to kings;<br />
Great Huitzilopotchli must, indeed, be strayed,<br />
Or, he will shake his thunders on the earth,<br />
And, strike the Aztecs from the face of him.<br />
War is the wastage of all human flesh,<br />
And whether man be stricken on the field,<br />
Or, with the sacred itztli, offered up,<br />
The measure must be met with human blood.<br />

And cannot otherwise perpetuate.<br />
The earth and heaven, both have set their mark<br />
Upon the bosom of the placid lake;<br />
And by the coming of those fiery stars,<br />
That flashed their baleful faces in the sky,<br />
All omenous that anger brooded o'er,<br />
The gods have read the purpose of your soul;<br />
And thus forwarn you that you must retract.<br />
They cry for victims and must be appeased;<br />
They gave you conquest without stay or stint,<br />
When you did furnish, full to their desire;<br />
But there are few within the shambles now,<br />
And they must be replenished, or the doom,<br />
That has forshadowed on the Eastern sky,<br />
Will flash and fall upon your naked head.<br />
Great Quetzalcoatl will come and strike you down,<br />
And grind you into ashes in his wrath."<br />
<br />
Then spoke the sturdy Counselor Teuhtlile<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>:<br />
"Tlalocan holds the nearest place to heaven,<br />
And in his zeal, doth sound the ready key<br />
That rhythms with your empire. We must suit<br />
Our action with his words, or we are lost.<br />
These pale-faced warriors must be met with alms;<br />
The gods must be appeased with fresh supplies.<br />

<div class='poem'>
"Let me, myself, go down upon the coast,<br />
And with our ready painters bring you back<br />
A full account of what we look upon.<br />
And if, perchance, these be the van of him<br />
Whose coming we have watched these many years,<br />
Then will we counsel further the emprise,<br />
And in the watch and wake of all events,<br />
Be not o'ertaken, but forestall the time."<br />
<br />
"Your counsel has the sanction it desires;<br />
I would not measure lances with the gods,"<br />
The monarch answered: "In the dust I bend,<br />
And plead the weakness of a human heart.<br />
The South shall furnish victims for the block;<br />
And Teuhtlile shall repair him to the coast;<br />
The dread monition of the flaming stars<br />
May be evaded with our ready zest.<br />
Our gold and precious stones, with lavish hand,<br />
Shall be poured out to coy them from our track;<br />
For what are all the earth's indulgences,<br />
Against the smiling favor of the gods?"<br />
<br />
"Repair thou to the coast, my good Teuhtlile,<br />
With plenteous retinue, and goodly stores;<br />
With cotton fabrics of the latest cast;<br />
With shields and cuirasses inlaid with gold;<br />
The burnished mirror of the fervent sun;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>The silver shining circlet of the moon;<br />
<br />
"With robes of feather-cloth made rich with pearls;<br />
And other trophies that your tact shall find.<br />
Receive them kindly, as becomes their state;<br />
And let thy wisdom gather in the full,<br />
Their purpose and intent upon our land;<br />
It may fall out they are as other men,<br />
Unsanctioned at the chambers of the gods,<br />
Yet must our moderation pave the way,<br />
Till we have fully compassed their intent."<br />
<br />
So said, so done; the embassy went forth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To meet the wily Spaniard on the coast;</span><br />
They little dreamed of what a forest fox<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They had to meet; they little knew the boast</span><br />
That hung upon the challenge of their fate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their superstitions made them ready prey;</span><br />
They opened wide their hospitable gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave the jewel of their life away.</span><br />
It mattered little how they forced it back,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tried to parley with their destiny;</span><br />
The hungry lion was upon their track,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they were lost forever and for aye.</span><br />
<br />
Done in the name of Christ? Oh, spare the word!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let not the Nazarene be buffeted;</span><br />
Gold was the souvenir; the pitying Lord<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was, with this nation, just as deeply bled.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>Their superstitions were the ready springs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Spaniards played upon to break their hearts;</span><br />
Deceit, as damnable as serpents' stings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Barbed with its cruel spines their poisoned darts.</span><br />
<br />
The embassy returned, and others went;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still could they not force back this coming cloud&mdash;</span><br />
The steady purpose and the black intent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wove with cunning fingers at their shroud.</span><br />
Had Spain come as the Pilgrims at Cape Cod,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or Penn upon the Delaware, to lead</span><br />
The Aztec back to fatherhood and God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let their sturdy manhood for them plead,</span><br />
How ready could their faces been upturned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hearts been melted into Christian mold!&mdash;</span><br />
The brand of hell was on their bare backs burned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they were ground to ashes for their gold!</span><br />
<br />
Did Christ e'er suffer such supreme disgrace?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or on the cross; or in Gethsemane?</span><br />
Did heavier drops of blood stand on his face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than there were forced by this foul treachery?</span><br />
Oh! how the patient Nazarene must bend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And break beneath fresh crosses every day&mdash;</span><br />
Fresh Judases betraying him as friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scorpions to sting him in the way!</span><br />
Thank God! the time is coming when, as Judge,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Man of Sorrows, ermined and supreme,</span><br />
No longer as a packhorse or a drudge,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall hold the scales and watch the balance beam!</span><br />
<br />
How heavy did he make the widow's mite;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How do the tears of men bend down the scale;</span><br />
How ponderous is a pennyweight of right;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How do the little things of life prevail!</span><br />
The Spanish Conquest, sometime, will be tried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against the heart Malinche<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> threw away,</span><br />
And Aztec's tears be placed against your pride.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Hispagniola! you will rue the day&mdash;</span><br />
A feather and a mountain to be weighed&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How shall the beam fly up at your disgrace,</span><br />
How shall your curse, a hundred fold, be paid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what a glory light up Aztlan's face!</span><br />
<br />
You came, like tender shepherds to the fold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, like a wolf, you tore the frighted flock;</span><br />
You kissed but to decoy them from their gold;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your seeming calm was but the earthquake's shock.</span><br />
Your empty babble of the cross and Christ,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was but the mask to cover your deceit;</span><br />
Your hearts were canker, but your words enticed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <i>never</i> did a fouler scheme make conquest more complete.</span><br />
<br />
Not Aztlan, with her bare and bleeding breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alone, hath felt thy treachery too late;</span><br />
Columbus, in his chains and sorely pressed,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bends to thy penalty for being great.</span><br />
A thousand white-robed saints with bony palms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shake their accusing fingers in thy face;</span><br />
Their bodies burned, their souls changed into psalms.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To chant in mournful cadence thy disgrace.</span><br />

<div class='title'>ARRIVAL OF THE SPANIARDS AT MEXICO.</div>

<div class='poem'>
November comes as Autumn's requiem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To sigh and sough the harvest, and the field,</span><br />
The winged ecstatics mourn, and then are dumb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And life and growth in full submission yield.</span><br />
Mexitli is not altogether clad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In nature's winding sheet of yellow leaves;</span><br />
And yet her year is getting old and sad,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And youth and fruitage at his bedside grieves.</span><br />
As on the lingering footsteps of the year&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A stranger and the Winter, hand in hand,</span><br />
Both on the threshold as two ghosts appear.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One strikes the orbit with its wasting sand,</span><br />
The other coils around the nation's throat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The nation and the year together die;</span><br />
Both on the waste of time are set afloat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sound alike death's mighty mystery.</span><br />
<br />
In all the glitter at his vast command,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went Montezuma to receive his guests;</span><br />
If gold be great, then was it truly grand.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The royal plume upon his forehead rests;</span><br />
His feet pressed soles of heavy beaten gold;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His cloak and anklets sprinkled o'er with pearls,</span><br />
<br />
And only noble hands are left to hold<br />
The blazing palanquin. Like titled Earls,<br />
They guard the skirts of royalty from stain<br />
Against the common people; all the same<br />
As in our ripened age. 'Tis hard to gain<br />
Much on the sodden march of royalty,<br />
Where accident supplants all other claim.<br />
The monarch in the easy prime of life,<br />
But lightly bronzed. The glowing, mellow hue<br />
That lit his cheek, seemed borrowed from the sun,<br />
And shadowing a heart that beat as true<br />
To God and country as he knew their names,&mdash;<br />
As any monarch that e'er wore a crown.<br />
His open-hearted welcome, like himself,<br />
Was, as the hardy <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'yoeman'">yeoman</ins>, bare and brown.<br />
<br />
He felt that he was meeting destiny,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet, to its solving, he would bend the knee</span><br />
With dignity and grace; not turn away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But face it with a ready, cheerful glance,</span><br />
And meeting night, surcharge it with the day;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And grasping, break, if possible, the lance</span><br />
That he felt sure was leveled at his breast.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He did not know the Inquisition stood,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>With rack and torture at his very gate;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That it had traveled half the world for blood</span><br />
To whet its throat for St. Bartholomew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And came with ravening appetite for him.</span><br />
Those wary messengers he little knew,<br />
Or those brown eyes would suddenly grown dim,<br />
And the warm heart would furnaced up its heat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he would grappled at its very throat;</span><br />
And man to man, and blood to blood, would meet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not a plume above one corselet float</span><br />
To bear the story back of it to Spain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They were not schooled in all the arts of war,</span><br />
Nor were they wise in all the world's deceit;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet would they fought beneath their fated star,</span><br />
And challenged every stubborn step, though it had proven vain.<br />
<br />
But in this fleecy covering, the wolf<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So hid its teeth that it was at the door</span><br />
Before they dreamed of treachery. The gulf<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay many leagues behind their foes; its shore</span><br />
And all the distance had been gained by stealth.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tlascala had been humbled on the march,</span><br />
And promised spoils from Montezuma's wealth;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But they had reached the keystone of the arch,</span><br />
At superstition's beck. The Aztec's gods<br />
Had chained their valor, or their greater odds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would crushed the viper, as it should have been,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And left it to a purer age, to seek a common kin.</span><br />
The Monarch gave them hostelry and cheer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Food of the rarest and the sparkling pulque,</span><br />
And quarters for their troopers, all quite near<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To his own palace gates. The very bulk</span><br />
Of his well-laden markets was thrown down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To their repletion, for their loaded board.</span><br />
They fared as princes favored of the crown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all the best the Kingdom could afford.</span><br />
The fair Malinche was interpreter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Montezuma spoke to them through her.</span><br />
<br />
He told them of the mighty Quetzalcoatl,<br />
And how he recognized them as his kin;<br />
He thought he had their history, the whole<br />
Vast riddle of their ancient origin.<br />
"I rule a mighty nation," quoth the King.<br />
"All Anahuac is subject to my sway;<br />
And yet, I recognize that you have come<br />
From the strong palace of a mightier lord,<br />
To whom I bend as subject; and with you<br />
We now will sway the scepter of his will.<br />
We long have watched his coming from the East,<br />
And now that he has sent his messengers,<br />
Our hearts are ready for his wise commands.<br />
We would have urged your coming on before,<br />
But that we heard of tales of cruelty,<br />
Which, haply we may now believe as false,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>We welcome you with all our open hearts,<br />
<br />
"And hope you may enjoy our humble fare.<br />
We are not wise, as you are, for our lives<br />
Have not caught wisdom from the fountain head,<br />
And hung upon the lips of Quetzalcoatl;<br />
Yet are we cousins in the faded past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And welcome you as brothers and as friends."</span><br />
<br />
How caught the Spanish Chieftain at the words!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How did he gloat upon this artifice!</span><br />
How useless hung their heavy-hilted swords<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they should win a nation at this price!</span><br />
With what a care he turned the dusty past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cover up the semblance of disguise;</span><br />
And fix their superstition still more fast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That he might clutch and carry home the prize.</span><br />
<br />
"There <i>is</i> grandeur in the tented field;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bivouac and the smoldering camp-fires."</span><br />
The human soul unconsciously must yield<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To its supremest charm, where man aspires</span><br />
To meet his fellow-man at one great bar;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And "valor speaks to valor" of its claim,</span><br />
In all the panoply of stubborn war,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drops the gauntlet in a nation's name.</span><br />
It may be terrible, but it is grand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see the banners flaunting in the breeze;</span><br />
To hear the bugle blare and stern command;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And see opposing forces strive to seize</span><br />
From Nature's stern arbitrament of force<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The laurel that shall deck the victor's brow;</span><br />
And turn the stream of nations from its course.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cutting of new sod by such a plow</span><br />
May tear up all the tender ties of life;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And hearts be turned to ashes in its path;</span><br />
These are the ponderous incidents of strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made legitimate when wrath meets wrath;</span><br />
But when the assassin creeps into our hearts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And draws around him all their sanctities,</span><br />
And he becomes a parcel of our parts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all we have or claim are made as his,</span><br />
What human brush can paint the upraised hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That smites our confidence at such an hour?</span><br />
What simile can human tongue command?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is, indeed, beyond our mortal power.</span><br />
We talk of devil, but the word is tame;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It cannot reach the climax we have sought;</span><br />
It only frets us into hotter flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And beggars all the litany of thought.</span><br />
<br />
I do not claim that Cortez was not brave;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor would I tear one laurel from his brow.</span><br />
I only claim he stole the devil's glaive;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He held it then, and let him hold it now.</span><br />
The issues of their lives are both with God,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The brown-eyed Monarch and the dark-eyed Knight.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>The flowers of charity should strew the sod<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above them both; yet, Cosmos! was it right?</span><br />
O world of human hearts and human lives!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was Montezuma worthy of this fate?</span><br />
O world of husbands! world of tender wives!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behold your Aztlan! bleeding, desolate,</span><br />
And say, if all their multiple of sins,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though they be blacker than the blackest night,</span><br />
Were worthy of the end that now begins<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To grind them down to powder? Was it right</span><br />
For Spain to steal the scepter from the hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That held it out in welcome to their doors,</span><br />
And poured their treasures out as free as sand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And oped with lavish all their loaded stores;</span><br />
To steal the key of superstition's gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And break the lock upon their hard-earned gold,</span><br />
And, fattening at their table, steal their plate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And feasting on their lambs to steal their fold;</span><br />
To make a prison of the room he gave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In which to hold the Monarch as a slave?</span><br />
O pitying God! thy thunderbolts were scarce.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why crushed they not this hell-begotten farce?</span><br />
<br />
And when the Aztecs, goaded to the quick<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the proud insolence of such a horde,</span><br />
Could bear no longer parley, but were sick<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of such a visitor at such a board,</span><br />
And rose en masse to crush the viper's fang,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">They bring the Monarch out to face the crowd,</span><br />
And plead for their immunity; the pang<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wrung his breast (for he, indeed, was proud)</span><br />
Was like an arrow in his royal heart;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet he prayed for their forgiveness then,</span><br />
And like a martyr bravely bore their part&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Search history; and find out greater men,</span><br />
And they are less forgiving. There he stood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His nation thronged before him, in its wrath;</span><br />
Yet did he plead, before this multitude,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To spare the serpent, now across their path;</span><br />
He could not name a promise not unbroke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He could not offer one excuse for time,</span><br />
He could not tell them why to hold their stroke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He plead for hands scarred over with their crime.</span><br />
<br />
Did ever charity reach loftier height?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can Christian Spain outshine this sad, brown face?</span><br />
How many souls in Christiandom, as white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would faced his countrymen, from such a place?</span><br />
Great Montezuma! where shall we find room!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Spain has such a multitude of saints</span><br />
To save your enemies, you courted doom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet would not kiss the cross with your complaints;</span><br />
Therefore, anathema!&mdash;It will not do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To pass a heretic at Heaven's gate;</span><br />
You held no mumbled <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'crucifix'">crusifix</ins> to view&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Infallible has said it, you must wait.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>Wait for a riper age to touch the chord<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That quivers, all unconsciously, your praise;</span><br />
When justice, <i>only</i>, draws the tardy sword,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Earth's abhorrence covers those old days</span><br />
With its <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'repentent'">repentant</ins> ashes, then my King<br />

Nor minstrels falter when they fain would sing<br />

The Holy Inquisition, from old Spain,<br />

The hissing fagots of sweet Mary's reign&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These million martyrs, with their melting glance,</span><br />
Look at <i>his</i> agony, across the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Who</i>, blind in superstition, groped his way</span><br />
O'er harmless victims and much misery<br />

<div class='title'>DEATH OF MONTEZUMA.</div>

<div class='poem'>
One sad, sad task, awaits my faltering pen,<br />
And I have done. One flower upon <i>his</i> grave,<br />
Who in his dying could, alas! not save<br />
His country from the vulturous maw of men.<br />
They played upon the monarch with their arts,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till he became a captive in their hands;</span><br />
It was consistent with their <i>Christian</i> hearts<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That their good host should follow their commands.</span><br />
They said their <i>Christian</i> lord across the sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must have his treasure for their <i>Christian</i> use.</span><br />
All this was bitter, yet, he did agree,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bent a patient knee to their abuse.</span><br />
<br />
They struck their temples, and the red, right hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Aztlan rose upon them. They could bear</span><br />
To see their monarch littled, and their land<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made tribute to a stranger; but, beware</span><br />
Stern warriors of Castile! touch not their gods.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hearts of Aztlan are but human hearts,</span><br />
And at some shrine the whole creation nods;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Invade the sanctum, and the whole man starts.</span><br />
Las Casas<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> would have won them with his love&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The potent key that opens every gate.</span><br />
Let not deceit claim sanction from above;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It may assist upon the wheels of fate,</span><br />
But what Spain offered through such legatees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was worse than powder on the bated flame.</span><br />
To gather fruit from such ill-freighted trees,<br />
Was worse than stealing nightmare from a dream.<br />
<br />
In Christ's good name they stole the monarch's gold;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They changed the name of Christ to treachery;</span><br />
They gathered all the spoils their hands could hold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pointed to their Master on the tree.</span><br />
Their Master? No! since Lucifer was hurled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down from the shining chambers of the just</span><br />
To vent his spleen upon a new-made world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He never had a worthier task in trust,</span><br />
Than that he gave to Spain's inglorious knights,<br />
To rob this people of their vested rights.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
The people gather at the palace gates,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And vengeance writes itself upon each face;</span><br />
Their generosity no longer waits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They spit upon, and spurn the outraged place.</span><br />
It harbors those who wrote themselves as knaves<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the pliant tablets of their lives,</span><br />
And now the incensed nation only craves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deliverance for their children and their wives.</span><br />
They know the belching cannon of the knights<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will make sad havoc in their stately host;</span><br />
They know that Spain and Fate to-day unite;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They know, if fortune fails them, all is lost;</span><br />
But they can bear no longer to be torn,<br />
And swear by all the gods to pluck this thorn.<br />
The Spaniards see their perfidy, too late;<br />
And call great Montezuma to the gate.<br />
"Why are my people here to-day in arms?<br />
These stranger friends are still my welcome guests;<br />
They soon will turn them backward to their homes.<br />
Shall we raise hands against great Quetzalcoatl?<br />
We fight against the gods? Lay down your arms!<br />
Go to your homes, and all shall yet be well,<br />
And peace shall reign in all Tenochtitlan<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a>!"<br />
They bent before him reverently at first.<br />
It was a moment&mdash;then their anger burst:<br />
"Base Aztec! woman! coward! sneaking slave!<br />
The whites have made a puppet of your name!<br />
Talk not of fighting 'gainst our honored gods;<br />
We soil their sacred robes if we submit!"<br />
A cloud of stones and arrows flew the air;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>And Montezuma fell a victim of <i>their</i> rage and <i>his</i> despair.<br />
His heart had broke when he beheld the throng,<br />
For he was burning with his country's wrong;<br />
And when the missiles smote his fevered crest,<br />
His very soul was reaching out for rest.<br />
<i>They</i> only helped to roll the burden off,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So long imprinted on his saddened face&mdash;</span><br />
It was <i>too</i> much to hear his people scoff&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He fell; and they removed him from the place.</span><br />
He never rose again, nor wished to rise;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He made no effort to outlive his land;</span><br />
He felt <i>his</i> weakness, and he heard <i>her</i> cries;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He saw <i>her</i> sinking with <i>his</i> wasting sand.</span><br />
He knew his enemies had stole the garb<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of gods to fasten on him their deceit;</span><br />
That they had stung the nation with their barb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he would not survive its sore defeat.</span><br />
He felt their scoffings were deserved of him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he should gathered wisdom with his years;</span><br />
He saw his weakness when his sight was dim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And poured his wasting moments out in tears.</span><br />

His country's honor, and its hard-earned gold.<br />

Great are the consolations of the cross&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Father-Son of Calvary, and time.</span><br />
Their glory compensates a kingdom's loss;<br />

Did all the roses blossom from the cross,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the thorns grow out upon the waste?</span><br />
Then were the metal guarded from the dross,<br />

Yet "figs cannot be gathered from the thorn,"<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the walls of old Chapultepec,</span><br />
Where stately trees, and flowers perennial bloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, all the pulses of their lives in check,</span><br />
Bow down to kiss the shrine of memory.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sacred hush of death comes none too oft</span><br />
To still the fevered brain and make us free&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is a gentle hand, and moves so soft</span><br />
That it compensates all our misery<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By chaining all the lions of our life</span><br />
And placing durance on the throbbing drum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That marshals us to earth's unpitying strife.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How should we reverence the hand that strikes our passions dumb!</span><br />
<br />
Cortez and Montezuma; Aztlan, Spain&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The very mingling of these words is pain.</span><br />
The one, bold, cold, unscrupulous and brave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And making of each obstacle a slave;</span><br />
Seeking <i>his</i> glory in the name of Christ,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To gain his ends unfaithful to each tryst.&mdash;</span><br />
The fault is with the ethics of his race,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which justify the means for <i>any</i> end,</span><br />
And leave the moral aspect without place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to the foulest acts their ready sanction lend.</span><br />
The thought of holding man to his account,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And throwing merit against circumstance,</span><br />
Of cleansing souls at one great common fount,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of holding out to man an equal chance&mdash;</span><br />
These things were not considered in the least.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The glory of himself and Spain were first;</span><br />
All the excesses pardoned by the Priest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weaned the poor soul from any moral thirst.</span><br />
A golden apple trembled on the limb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he must pluck it, at whatever cost.</span><br />
What matter whose?&mdash;it should belong to him;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was too tempting, and must not be lost:</span><br />
The wall that lay before it must be scaled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The owner of the field must be destroyed,</span><br />
And if his <i>prowess</i>, in the effort failed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Deceit</i> and <i>treachery</i> must be employed.</span><br />
The unbridled passions of the human soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Linked with the crucifix in his emprise.</span><br />
The lion, loosened and in full control&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The semblance of the Lamb to Aztlan's eyes:</span><br />
A faithful offspring of the Papish loins,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The features of the Church in duplicate,</span><br />

No greener shrine for memory can be sought;<br />

In history's cloister; Egypt and Aztlan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strike palms upon the bridges of the years;</span><br />
But Spain denies the privilege to man,<br />

<div class='title'>CONCLUSION.</div>

<div class='poem'>
From sire to son the stern bequeathment falls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of some misguided action in the past,</span><br />
And, though our nature with the victim calls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we are smitten with his overcast,</span><br />
Still are we weak against the wheels of fate,<br />
Which leaves the pensioner thus desolate.<br />
<br />
The by-ways of the father must turn back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sometime upon the highway that he left;</span><br />
Though dark and sinuous may be the track,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And life of all its luster be bereft,</span><br />
Still hangs the heavy impulse on the soul,<br />
Unsatisfied, till it shall reach its goal.<br />
<br />
The destiny was hard that brought proud Spain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the fading summerland of gold;</span><br />
Its retribution is no less a pain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grip of fate, so pulseless and so cold,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>Brings back the shudder to the human heart;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Humanity is wounded with <i>each</i> part</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tender conquest of some heathen land</span><br />
The brightest jewel is, of any crown&mdash;<br />
God never licensed human hand to strike a foe when down.<br />

When Spain's recruited army turned them back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To glut their ire on Guatamozin's head,</span><br />
There never was a deeper furrowed track,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More thickly cindered with the myriad dead;</span><br />
And when at last his bloody sceptre fell,<br />
Tenochtitlan was likest to a hell.<br />
<br />
The brave barbarian was put to rack<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To force divulgence of his scattered gold.&mdash;</span><br />
Is there a garment of a deeper black,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To cover up the fingers that could hold</span><br />
Such hellish orgies after all the past?<br />
The palm is thine, O Spain! and hold it to the last!<br />
<br />
Yet one more turn upon the screw of time:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy red, right hand must slay this waif of fate;</span><br />
And thou must put the climax to the crime,<br />

<h2>MALINCHE.</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>I may properly place "Malinche" as supplementary to
"Montezuma," as dealing with characters coincident to,
and cotemporaneous with those concerned in the "Conquest,"
and also as covering a period subsequent to, and
immediately succeeding the Conquest.</p>

<p>To the student of history, Malinche (in her position of
interpreter during the entire period of the Conquest) presents
at once so much that is unique and charming, and
yet such a sad commentary on the criminal practices of
the sixteenth as well as the nineteenth centuries, that I
have often wondered that a stronger and more practiced
hand has not ere this claimed the privilege of championship.</p>

<p>According to Prescott, she was born in the town
of Painnalla, Province of Coatzacualco, in the southeastern
extremity of what is now Mexico; that she was the
daughter of a Cacique (a sort of provincial Governor)
and prospective heiress to large estates; that after the
death of her father, her mother, with indecent haste,
forms another union, and in time presents the stepfather
with a son; that they jointly combine to be rid of Malinche,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
whom they sell to itinerant traders; and, to cover
their device, they pretend that she is sick and use the
child of a servant for their criminal pantomime; the
child dies, thus completing the deception, except the
hypocritical mourning to which this unnatural mother is
said to have been equal.</p>

<p>Malinche is sold by the traders to the Cacique of Tabasco, and
reaches maturity about the time of the Conquest.
She seems to have been a favorite in the house of the
Cacique, which would indicate that he had become acquainted
with her origin, and after the surrender of the
town to Cortez, she is one of the twenty female slaves
presented to the Conqueror and his allies.</p>

<p>Either from enlarged opportunities or her natural aptness,
and probably both, she is found by Cortez to be
just the person he needs for interpreter. Mutual attraction
leads them into the closest relations, and it is but just to
Malinche to state that there is no indication of her
knowledge of the Conqueror's wife in Cuba, until she arrives
at the Capitol. There is also nothing to indicate more
than a momentary estrangement between Malinche and
Catalina.</p>

<p>Catalina lived but about three months after her arrival
at Mexico; and it seems that Malinche assumes the same
relations as before, when Cortez journeys South, where in
time they reach the precincts of the maiden's nativity, and
she meets her mother, after all the years of their cruel
separation. Here the beautiful sincerity of the Christianity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
she had espoused, shines forth as she quiets her
mother's fears, and professes to doubt her mother's original
intent to sell her. She loads her mother with jewels
and seems to cherish no feeling not consistent with the
warmest relations of daughter and mother.</p>

<p>The statement soon after is, that Cortez presents her to
Don Xamarillo with all the sanction of marriage, and he
enriches her with some of the largest estates in her native
province; and there the historic account closes. Incidentally,
it is mentioned that a son was born during the
period of this <i>affaire du <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'coeur'">c&oelig;ur</ins></i>.</p>

<p>I stated that the historic account closes here, but M.
Charny and others enlarge on the traditionary feeling of
South Eastern Mexico, and if we may credit his statements
(and many times tradition carries more heart and
more of the essential elements of truth in it than the cold
pencil of history), Malinche is so woven into the social
structure as to become almost the patron saint of that
part of the country.</p>

<p>And Prescott (rather inclined to the fruit than the
blossom of history) speaks of Malinche as being reverently
held by the Aztec descendants as the guardian angel of
Chapultepec.</p>

<p>I have endeavored thus to present the salient features
of this part of the historic drama, adding and enlarging
only as it became necessary to connect the events and do
justice to the fair subject of the endeavor; and whatever
criticism may be offered, I can, without hesitancy, claim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the credit of candor and a desire to eliminate from all the
facts of the case the plain, unvarnished truth.</p>

<p>I began at first to write the idyl in nine-syllabic measure,
but soon found myself cramped in expression, and
in recopying I have thrown off restraint and used the
double terminal with both nine and ten syllables, having
no desire and finding no occasion to use the eight syllable
measure which Longfellow has so immortalized in
the "Song of Hiawatha."</p>

<p>The sacred relations of man and wife, like those of
any other <i>sacrament</i> entered into voluntarily, are no less
binding in the <i>spirit</i> than in the <i>letter</i> of the law; and
it is a gratifying truth that the statutes of many of the
States of the Union are being so remodeled as to recognize
the <i>fact</i>, rather than the <i>form</i> of marriage; and
the tendency is, certainly toward the correction of many
abuses, as leading to a more enlarged knowledge of
social responsibilities.</p>

<p>As long as the sad story of Malinche has a present
application, and may be said to be the perspective of the
grossly distorted foreground of our social structure, so
long will its rehearsal have its use in the world; and I
only regret that a stronger hand and a more perfect
pen might not have been loaned to its portrayal.</p>

<h2>MALINCHE.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
Old Painnalla of Coat-za-cual-co,<br />
Passing down the road of the "Conquest,"<br />
Through the silent portals of Lethe,<br />
Was greatest of Mexican hamlets;<br />
The birthplace of brown-eyed Malinche,<br />
Whom the Spaniards call Dona Marina;<br />
And the noble Cacique, great Tezpitla,<br />
With his shrew of a wife, Zunaga&mdash;<br />
All are names deserving of story,<br />
For they cling to the garment of greatness.<br />
<br />
A daughter is born to Zunaga,<br />
And the worthy Cacique Tezpitla,<br />
Though he warms to the little stranger,<br />
Had hoped that the gods would have given<br />
A son and Cacique for the province.<br />
They named their young daughter Malinche;<br />
The priest called the gods to protect her,<br />
And sprinkled her brow and her bosom<br />
With water, the purest of emblems;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Commends her to Tez-cat-li-po-ca,<br />
The soul of the earth and the heavens;<br />
To Quet-zal-coatl, god of the harvest;<br />
And at all the shrines with their homage,<br />
They offered the richest of jewels.<br />
<br />
Tezpitla soon sleeps with his fathers,<br />
And Malinche, too young to have known him,<br />
Has hardly begun with her prattle,<br />
Ere he passes away to the sunset,<br />
To the palace of gold Tonatu',<br />
Where his warriors had gone on before him<br />
To their rest, in the dazzling chambers<br />
That shine from the face of the day god.<br />
<br />
Zunaga a little while murmurs,<br />
And mourns at the chieftain's departure,<br />
When Mohotzin, a friend of Tezpitla<br />
(Who had shared oft times in his battles<br />
And sat many times at his table),<br />
In sympathy visits the widow;<br />
And his sympathy turns to wooing,<br />
His wooing and winning are easy.<br />
For Zunaga (the name of the faithless)<br />
Yields a ready ear to his sighing,<br />
And pity is parent of loving.<br />
The bride takes the place of the widow,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>And the funeral leads to the wedding.<br />
<br />
A son is soon born to Mohotzin,<br />
And the sire with the faithless Zunaga,<br />
Bend their heads to the hurt of the helpless,<br />
To disherit the artless daughter;<br />
She sends up inquisitive glances,<br />
To the guilty eyes of her parents.<br />
Thus the perfect faith of our childhood,<br />
Stands to smite at the evil endeavor,<br />
Yet how is it cruelly wounded<br />
By the cunning hand of its kindred!<br />
<br />
She is sold as a slave to the merchants,<br />
Whose itinerant traffic encounters<br />
This cruel and conscienceless couple.<br />
Scarcely five years the miniature maiden,<br />
When decoyed from her favorite pastimes,<br />
Under guise of a frolicsome journey;<br />
She is hurried away into bondage,<br />
To gain the estate for her brother.<br />
And all this is done under shadow<br />
To cover the basest of actions.<br />
Malinche is said to be dying,<br />
The mother is bent at the bedside,<br />
Where is laid the child of a servant;<br />
It dies, to complete the deception,<br />
And Zunaga bewails, as is fitting<br />
In well painted actions, the daughter.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>The funeral pageant is greater<br />
Than the one attending Tezpitla;<br />
And thus, did the misnomered mother<br />
Strive to hide the print of her sinning.<br />
<br />
How fares it with bonnie Malinche,<br />
Thus stung in the morn of her childhood?<br />
The merchants have gone to Tabasco,<br />
The slaves are the bearers of burden,<br />
The maid is thus borne from her kindred.<br />
She, too young to plead for ransom,<br />
Little heeds the force of her venture;<br />
And in time, they have traversed the river,<br />
And have reached the town of Tabasco.<br />
The merchants immured in their traffic,<br />
Sell the maid to a wealthy landlord,<br />
The worthy Cacique of the province.<br />
<br />
Thus cruelly shorn of her birthright,<br />
Malinche grows up as a servant<br />
In the house of this wealthy master,<br />
The playmate and charm of his children.<br />
She gathers the boon of contentment<br />
With the easy faith of her childhood.<br />
Her mother is almost forgotten,<br />
When a former nurse of Zunaga,<br />
Having served the time of her ransom,<br />
Has sought the Cacique for employment.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>She knows the whole piteous story,<br />
Of the maid and her heartless mother;<br />
Her soul is drawn back to the maiden,<br />
And she knows, with the whole of her nature,<br />
That this is her old master's daughter.<br />
And Malinche, across the threshold,<br />
Calls back all the thoughts of her childhood,<br />
And each feels the grasp of the other,<br />
And the past is all plain to Malinche.<br />
<br />
The noble Cacique of Tabasco<br />
Heard all of the pitiful story,<br />
And swore, by the gods, to avenge her<br />
"Of her cruel and faithless mother,<br />
With her heart as hard as the itztli,<br />
The sanctified blade of the prophet."<br />
He would seek the king, Moctheuzoma,<br />
That ruled in the city of temples,<br />
Tenochtitlan, greatest of cities,<br />
And tell him the tale of Malinche,<br />
That all of her wrongs might be righted<br />
And the maiden restored to her birthright.<br />
<br />
But, in the white heat of his anger,<br />
A stranger appears at the river&mdash;<br />
'Tis the pale-faced chief, and his army,<br />
With his soldiers clad like the fishes,<br />
With the shining scales for their frontlets,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>With their weapons charged with the lightning,<br />
Like the thunderbolts of great Thaloc,<br />
With their four-legged gods, like the bison,<br />
With the head of a man in the center,<br />
And the flaming nostril distended,<br />
Breathing fire, like the front of a dragon,<br />
When they shake the earth with their tramping.<br />
Surely these were the legates of heaven,<br />
Great Quetzalcoatl, surely fought with them.<br />
And in vain was the chieftain's endeavor,<br />
Tabasco soon fell to their prowess,<br />
And they must now purchase <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'appeasment'">appeasement</ins>.<br />
And the worthy Cacique of Tabasco<br />
Forgets all his pledges of ransom,<br />
And Malinche is one of the twenty,<br />
Of the maids that he gives to Cortez.<br />
As pure as the bright water lily<br />
That shines from the rim of Tezcuco;<br />
As bright as the rays of Tonatu',<br />
Rising out of the gulf of Mexitli;<br />
As chaste as the moon in its glances,<br />
At the mirroring face of Chalco;<br />
As fresh as the breezes that banquet<br />
The morn in the isles of the spices&mdash;<br />
Even such was the Maid of Painnalla,<br />
The beautiful brown-eyed Malinche.<br />
<br />
Cortez has been seeking a sponsor<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>To ravel the intricate language,<br />
When he is informed of the maiden,<br />
And she is first brought to his presence.<br />
A favorite child of the household,<br />
She is robed in the neatest of vestures.<br />
The feather-cloth covers her shoulders,<br />
Her waist is enclosed with a girdle<br />
Holding skirt of the finest of cotton,<br />
Her feet on the daintiest sandals,<br />
Her face, veiled with gossamer pita,<br />
Lends the highest charm to her blushes.<br />
<br />
With Aguilar first she converses<br />
(He had lived some years with the natives,<br />
Borne ashore where his vessel had stranded).<br />
She had learned all the various shadings,<br />
The many and quaint dialections,<br />
Of the several Anahuac nations;<br />
And not long till the noble Castilian<br />
Yields its palm to her ready conquest.<br />
The mighty commander, brave Cortez,<br />
With his piercing dark eyes, was her teacher;<br />
For love is the aptest of pupils,<br />
And the heart is your ready translator.<br />
The words of the Chief were no longer<br />
The meaningless voice of the stranger,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>But the language of Spain and of heaven.<br />
<br />
Cortez, cast a thought to the island;<br />
To his early love, Catalina;<br />
To the prison of fierce Velasquez;<br />
His reluctant marriage in Cuba.<br />
Yet, how faithful had been the Dona!<br />
And never yet had been broken<br />
<i>His</i> pledges of perfect devotion;<br />
But the morals of Hispagniola<br />
Are subject to easiest bending.<br />
The priest giving ready indulgence<br />
To sins that are nearest to nature,<br />
And Malinche, robbed of her birthright<br />
And denied the boon of a mother,<br />
Had only her love to direct her,<br />
Which led her unerring to Cortez;<br />
He opened his arms to receive her,<br />
(She, the purest jewel of Aztlan)<br />
And, as moth falls into the torchlight,<br />
She fell to his brilliant alluring.<br />
<br />
If purest of wifely devotion,<br />
With its love that is <i>all</i> of woman,<br />
If the absence of wrong intention<br />
In the innocent glow of nature,<br />
Uninspired by the shadow of evil,<br />
Made her wife, she was wife of Cortez.<br />
Not a whisper of Catalina,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>His beautiful wife on the island,<br />
Had the chieftain given the maiden;<br />
And she felt as free as the water<br />
On the rugged brink of 'Morenci;<br />
As the bee to gather the honey<br />
From the nectaries on the mountains<br />
And the multiple bloom of the valleys.<br />
She thought there was naught to prevent her<br />
From her lavish of love on the Chieftain.<br />
<br />
O the faith that is always faultless,<br />
That ever grows up toward Heaven,<br />
(To the center of love returning)<br />
Whence it sprang as seed from the Godhead!<br />
How its track is hounded by evil!<br />
How its purity pants in the darkness!<br />
How it flutters into the pitfalls!<br />
And how its white wings are broken<br />
And its plumage stained and bedraggled!<br />
But 'tis only the earth that despoils it,<br />
To teach it more earnest endeavor,<br />
To lift the wing higher in ether,<br />
And fix the eye firmer on Heaven.<br />
<br />
But alas! for bonnie Malinche;<br />
Her faith had no heavenly fragrance,<br />
Except in its helpless dependence.<br />
It knew not the way of the angels,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>But groped like the vine in the cavern,<br />
Always reaching out for the sunlight,<br />
Always tender and white of fiber.<br />
And the worthy father, Olmedo,<br />
Taught the maid the lore of the ages;<br />
Taught of life, and death, and the Savior,<br />
And the beautiful boon, resurrection,<br />
And the story of Magdalene,<br />
Of much loving, and much forgiving;<br />
Yet he whispered naught of the Chieftain,<br />
And the maiden lived on in blindness,<br />
Though "Credos" and "Ave Marias"<br />
Fell as pearls from the lips thus laden<br />
With the story of Jesu' and Mary.<br />
And as Christ touched the lips of childhood<br />
And made them the text of his sermon,<br />
(The innocent sponsors of Heaven)<br />
Malinche, enrapt at the story,<br />
Shined out through her every action,<br />
Translating the life of the God-Son,<br />
To speak in behalf of her people.<br />
She plead for the chiefs of Tlascala&mdash;<br />
Las Casas had no abler ally<br />
When he struck the stone heart of Cortez&mdash;<br />
And the stonier heart of Castile,<br />
In his earnest prayer for the Aztecs<br />
And the ill-starred King Moctheuzoma.<br />
Her blood gave its ardent petition<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>In behalf of her race and her people,<br />
Her bronzed hand pressing the balance<br />
On the side of mercy and manhood.<br />
<br />
When the light first shines in the cavern<br />
Damp and dark with moldering ages,<br />
It gathers each gleam of the crystals<br />
That cycles have hoarded in brilliance;<br />
So the heart, groping back to the sunlight,<br />
Over graves of its superstitions,<br />
Throws its shoots through every crevice<br />
That promises health to its fibers.<br />
Thus the virgin soul of Malinche<br />
(The image of God on its tablet)<br />
Made the glow of her first impressions<br />
The heart and the soul of the gospel.<br />
<br />
But how cunningly clasp the fetters<br />
That fate has unconsciously molded;<br />
And yet, how they pinion our passport<br />
On the trend of further indulgence&mdash;<br />
The conquest was hardly completed,<br />
And the maid in the fullest enjoyment<br />
Of the treasure she aided to purchase<br />
When the island divulges its secret,<br />
And the wife of his early loving,<br />
And the wife of his after loathing,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>Appears at the door of the Chieftain.<br />
O Malinche! brown-eyed Malinche!<br />
The finger of fate is upon you;<br />
The wrongs of your conscienceless mother<br />
Were the scar and bane of your <i>childhood</i>.<br />
The years with their velveted footfalls<br />
Have forced them far back in the shadows,&mdash;<br />
But here comes a heart that is bleeding<br />
For the touch of its earliest treasure.<br />
With an even right you have won it;<br />
Upon your warm bosom have worn it.<br />
But another, unknown, has possessed it,<br />
And puts forth her hand to recover.<br />
Will you strike at her just petition?<br />
Love is love; but hers is the older,<br />
And it has grown sharp with its longing;<br />
The hunger of years is upon it,<br />
And pleads all the patience of loving.<br />
<br />
They met, the brown maid of Painnalla<br />
And the pale, blushing rose of the island,&mdash;<br />
Malinche and sad Catalina.<br />
The Dona gave voice to her murmur<br />
In words that were pungent and bitter,<br />
Reproaching the maid for the beauty<br />
That had stolen the heart of her husband.<br />
But Malinche returned no reproaches<br />
When she heard the whole truth from the Dona;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>But her tears, as the dew of the morning,<br />
Which like diamonds filled her dark lashes,<br />
Smote the tender heart of the maiden:<br />
<br />
"O maiden, most hard and unconscious!"<br />
Cried Malinche, out of her sobbing,<br />
"Hear the bitter tale of my lifetime;<br />
And the Heavenly melting of pity<br />
Will fill all the place of your loathing."<br />
Then she told her the whole sad story&mdash;<br />
How her cruel mother betrayed her,<br />
How she fell a slave to the Chieftain,<br />
And was called upon to interpret.<br />
"But the heart is easily broken,<br />
Fair maiden!" Malinche continued.<br />
"And before I knew, I had fallen;<br />
And I hung on his matchless features,<br />
The wonderful glow of his prowess,<br />
And the liquid flow of his language,<br />
Till I could no longer resist him.<br />
I thought I was free to embrace him,<br />
And I gave my whole life to his keeping.<br />
How I thrilled to his first caressing,<br />
And panted to gather his kisses!<br />
How I hung on the lips of the morning<br />
That shadowed his life with new danger!<br />
Could I die for the love I bore him,<br />
I would pity the weight of the casket<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>That gave such a featherlike measure;<br />
Could I stand in the breach of danger<br />
To shelter his form from the missile,<br />
I could mourn that the Father had given<br />
But only one heart for the arrow.<br />
I loved him! I loved him! I loved him!<br />
And this is my furtherest pleading."<br />
<br />
And long ere Malinche had finished<br />
The Dona had mingled her weeping,<br />
And each held the hand of the other<br />
In truce of their worthless repining;<br />
And Malinche, as Magdalene,<br />
Would have washed the feet of her Master,<br />
But the Dona rather preferred her<br />
As <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'compainon'">companion</ins> and friend in pastime;<br />
So they passed their time in the solace<br />
Of a friendship closely cemented.<br />
<br />
But the beautiful flower of the island<br />
Fell a prey to the varying climate<br />
And the dormant love of the Chieftain.<br />
She pointed her white hands to heaven,<br />
And she gave back to Mary Mother<br />
Her tired soul as white as the snowdrift.<br />
The busy brown hands of Malinche<br />
Had never once tired of their office<br />
In smoothing her feverish pillows.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>Her fresh, perfect faith pointing upward,<br />
Helped to pinion the soul for its passage.<br />
"Farewell to thee, fair Catalina!<br />
Though you tore my heart with your coming,<br />
You have torn it worse with your going.<br />
May the angels, shrouding your sorrow,<br />
Pour their multiple bliss in your welcome,<br />
And paradise pant with your beauty,<br />
And Heaven, as white as your goodness,<br />
Shine out through the doors for Malinche;<br />
For I envy your early passage,<br />
And would gladly have gone before you.<br />
I have found earth's love but a fetter<br />
To cripple the wing of our exit."<br />
<br />
And after he humbled the Aztecs,<br />
The Chieftain soon turned to the southward,<br />
Still holding the hand of Malinche,<br />
As if the cold palm of the Dona<br />
Had never intruded its presence;<br />
His memory, cold as her pulses,<br />
Gave hardly a throb at departure,<br />
But Malinche wept o'er her ashes,<br />
And prayed that the blessing of Heaven<br />
Might comfort the soul of the Dona;<br />
Yet she held not her hand from the Chieftain,<br />
Though she chid with the love of the turtle;<br />
Yet her heart could not harrow its fallow<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Though a hundred-fold lay in the effort.<br />
<br />
The ill-fated Chief Guatamozin<br />
(Who succeeded the great Moctheuzoma,<br />
And so stubbornly fought for his people)<br />
Had fared the same fate of the Monarch,<br />
Except that he gazed on the ashes,<br />
And saw the cold ghost of his nation<br />
Pass out through the gates of the sunset,<br />
And all just a little before him.<br />
He attended Cortez on his journey,<br />
With other great men of his people;<br />
Never man was more loyal to master<br />
Than the throneless King to his Chieftain&mdash;<br />
To the cavalcade came a rumor,<br />
That the life of Cortez was endangered<br />
By a plot of the Aztec attendants<br />
(Cortez was the stoniest master,<br />
To the Knights as well as the natives,<br />
And no wonder his life should be threatened.<br />
<br />
The scar of a crime on our nature,<br />
With remembrance of wrong we inflicted,<br />
Puts a double watch on our victim;<br />
We are prone to measure in manner,<br />
Each soul in the pitiful bushel<br />
That holds the shrunk grains of <i>our</i> manhood.)<br />
And Cortez turned his eyes for an answer,<br />
To the plot that was laid for his footsteps,<br />
On the staunch Aztec King, Guatamozin;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>He had fought a brave battle for Aztlan,<br />
And the Spaniards had felt his prowess<br />
In the hardly wrenched sword of their triumph;<br />
But when the despair of his nation<br />
Settled down on his heart as a mountain,<br />
No treachery lingered to poison<br />
The flow of his deeply drawn sadness.<br />
<br />
Yet, the wrongs he had laid on the people,<br />
Stalked out as a ghost on the Chieftain.<br />
And the sad eyes of poor Guatamozin,<br />
Were his guilty conscience' accuser;<br />
And though not a stain was upon him,<br />
Yet the Chief was condemned by Cortez.<br />
Then Malinche's warm heart overflowing,<br />
When she saw how unjust was the sentence,<br />
Gave its plea with the beautiful pathos<br />
Of the life that is simple and loving.<br />
Though she was baptized as a Christian,<br />
And was charmed with the life of the God-Son,<br />
Yet the water the priest sprinkled on her<br />
Purged not from her veins the warm Aztec<br />
Which, charged with a just indignation,<br />
Poured out on her Chieftain its measure:<br />
<br />
"As a faithful God is my witness&mdash;<br />
Not a throb of my heart has wasted<br />
Its pulse on the suit of another,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>Since you glittered my life with its purchase,<br />
I have loved you too well for my worship,<br />
Which has hardly a God, but my Chieftain;<br />
But I plead for my country and people&mdash;<br />
You showed me a Christ that was loving,<br />
Whose life was a psalm of forgiveness,<br />
Who touched the hot lips of our anger<br />
With the tender finger of patience.<br />
I was won by his great example,<br />
It <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'warned'">warmed</ins> the cold stone of the Aztec<br />
With the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'radient'">radiant</ins> beams of the morning;<br />
It loosened the chains from the ankles<br />
That were swift on errands of mercy;<br />
It tore off the scales from the eyelids<br />
That were blinded with superstition;<br />
Gave freedom to innocent victims,<br />
From the fearful death of the itztli;<br />
And winged back the soul to its manor,<br />
From the desert and dust of the ages.<br />
<br />
"But where is the Christ you were pleading&mdash;<br />
The merciful God of your banner?<br />
The nails of the cross are your sword points,<br />
And his pleadings the parent of carnage.<br />
His merciful words are but margods,<br />
To hurl on your host to the slaughter.<br />
As I pleaded for Moctheuzoma<br />
That you spare him the shame of his prison,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>So I plead for the brave Guatamozin,<br />
Though he fought so hard for the Aztecs,<br />
I would balance my life on his honor.<br />
The traitor is not of such metal,<br />
At your front&mdash;in your face&mdash;he may strike you;<br />
But he takes not the night for his helmlet,<br />
Nor is treachery ever his weapon.<br />
Then spare him, my noble Hernando!"<br />
But her prayers were in vain for the victim,<br />
The heart of Cortez was relentless;<br />
And another brave soul winged its passage,<br />
To try if the gates of the city<br />
Still turn for the broken in spirit.<br />
<br />
In time they drew near to Painnalla,<br />
And the tale of her childhood confronts her,<br />
Though she hardly can call up one feature<br />
To gaze on the face of another,<br />
And each say to each, "We are brothers";<br />
Yet the story has lived with her living,<br />
And been fanned by the fervor of gossip;<br />
And Malinche's warm heart has been shaken,<br />
O'er the bitterest brink of a trial.<br />
<br />
Her Chieftain, grown great with his conquest,<br />
Thrusts the knife of his pride to her heartstrings,<br />
In search of some noble alliance;<br />
And she must be weaned from his wooing.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>As only <i>one</i> God lighteth Heaven,<br />
She has held the <i>one</i> place in his household,<br />
Than which has the earth none more sacred.<br />
Yet the shade of the poor Catalina<br />
Has shown her how weak is the Chieftain,<br />
And the bolt is thus broken in falling;<br />
Still her whole heart presses the balance,<br />
And a sacred thing was her loving,<br />
For love is the latch-key to Heaven.<br />
<br />
But she tries to force back her sorrow<br />
At the sacred shrine of her birthplace;<br />
And the angels are gentle that hover<br />
At the rustic shade of the hearthstone.<br />
All the sorrow comes out of the shadow,<br />
All the bitterness bathes in the sunshine,<br />
The stubbornest pangs of resentment<br />
Are cooled to the calm of forgiveness;<br />
And charity cradles the armor<br />
That was harnessed in bristling anger.<br />
<br />
Her mother is summoned with others<br />
At the call of Cortez to assemble,<br />
And Malinche sees mother and brother<br />
Through the soul of an earnest hunger.<br />
She (young in all things but her sorrow,<br />
And with only her nature to prompt her)<br />
Beholds, with the heart of a daughter,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>The mother that cruelly spurned her,<br />
In the fading Spring of her lifetime.<br />
The mother, as ready responding<br />
To the tie that her crime would have broken,<br />
Sees her child, like the face of a spectre,<br />
Rising out of the grave to accuse her,<br />
And in terror would fly from her presence;<br />
But Malinche sprang forward to grasp her,<br />
And, forgetting all else but her mother,<br />
Poured out her full heart in caresses,<br />
<br />
Saying, "Surely, my mother, you knew not<br />
When you sold me away to the traders;<br />
Surely, not with your voice could you sanction,<br />
Your words would have frozen together,<br />
And not with your heart you consented.<br />
The blood would have whited to marble;<br />
Some artifice surely was practiced.<br />
My mother was <i>always</i> my mother;<br />
And though you unwittingly sold me,<br />
Malinche is free to forgive you.<br />
Take back to your bosom your daughter,<br />
It is all for the best that we parted,<br />
For it gave me my sweet Mary Mother<br />
With her child, the immaculate God-Son;<br />
And better a slave and a Christian,<br />
Than a priest in the pay of the temple.<br />
And, yet, how I longed for a mother,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>To show the clear trail for my footsteps,<br />
<br />
And to hold the white hand of my childhood!<br />
With no other mother but Mary<br />
(Sweet Mary, the soul of compassion),<br />
I have tried to grow up towards Heaven;<br />
But a mother on earth is the blessing<br />
That can never be held by another.<br />
Our flesh will not float on the pinions<br />
That bear to Elysian our spirits;<br />
Our hearts are too warm for the angels,<br />
To hush with their transparent fingers;<br />
Our lips are too ready for kisses<br />
To be cooled to the calm of devotion;<br />
Our hands are too warm in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'anothers'">another's</ins><br />
To be folded in supplication;<br />
Too much of the earth is about us<br />
To be lost in the halo of Heaven&mdash;<br />
So we need the cool heart of the mother<br />
That has passed the hot chaos of passion,<br />
To temper the pulse that is wayward.<br />
<br />
"Yet I cannot have wandered so greatly,<br />
When love was the only impulsion,<br />
Such a distance away from the Master<br />
Whose name is the essence of loving;<br />
But he sees the bare heart in its throbbing,<br />
And the crystallized faith of my footsteps<br />
That were only too quick in their choosing.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>Surely, Love, the benificent Master,<br />
Springing forth from the bosom of Mary,<br />
To smother the earth with caresses,<br />
Will drop a light hand on the shoulder<br />
That shadows a heart that has wandered<br />
By only its warm overflowing."<br />
<br />
She loaded her mother with jewels,<br />
And left not the shadow of malice<br />
To stain the fair skirts of her mercy,<br />
But canceled her wrongs with caresses,<br />
And covered the past with forgiveness.<br />
Thus she bore the whole soul of the Gospel<br />
To the hungry hearts of her people;<br />
And the heart is not hard to the sermon<br />
That carries a life for its background<br />
As perfectly pure as the precept.<br />
The heathen is waiting the harvest&mdash;<br />
Only hallowed hands for the sickle;<br />
When the life and the lip move together<br />
Millennium waits on the morning.<br />
<br />
The trial that sometimes had shadowed<br />
Comes at last in its fullness upon her,<br />
And the pride of Cortez seeks another<br />
For the place that is only Malinche's.<br />
And he offers to Don Xamarillo<br />
The tremulous hand of the maiden,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>As if it was his to bestow her<br />
As a chattel&mdash;a token of friendship&mdash;<br />
On his friend and bosom companion.<br />
The anger of love was upon her,<br />
And all of her beauty shone brightest,<br />
As she flashed on her recreant lover<br />
The flaming scourge of her protest:<br />
<br />
"I came as a slave to your camp-ground;<br />
You lifted me out of my bondage,<br />
For you knew I was free in my birthright.<br />
You wooed me, and won me as lover,<br />
And only as wife could have worn it;<br />
I have drawn on your love as a garment.<br />
You first sought me out as a sponsor,<br />
But the language of Spain is a magnet<br />
That drew me all out of Malinche<br />
And made me a part of her Chieftain;<br />
And now you would sunder the tendrils<br />
And force back the vine from the branches<br />
Where they learn't all of life in reclining,<br />
And never can unlearn the lesson.<br />
<br />
"O, Hernando, you know not Malinche!<br />
If you think she can cherish another<br />
In the heart she too willingly gave you;<br />
Were you priest of the Aztec temple,<br />
And should raise in your hand the itztli,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>To open the breast of your victim;<br />
My heart would leap out at your calling,<br />
E're the word of your summons was spoken.<br />
Ask me to anticipate Heaven,<br />
And my life would be swift in its forfeit.<br />
But to learn the love of another,<br />
And to wean me from your caresses,<br />
Is beyond the wisdom of granting.<br />
The logic of love hath a limit,<br />
Only God can re-tension our heart-strings.<br />
<br />
"Oh, Hernando! my prince and my primate,<br />
My husband on earth and in Heaven!<br />
Let me cling to your feet as a hand-maid,<br />
And wash with my tears, as another<br />
Did moisten the feet of our Savior,<br />
But drive me not hence from your presence.<br />
I can never love Xamarillo&mdash;<br />
He can fetter the hand of Malinche,<br />
But her heart will go over the ocean<br />
And will smite at your breast when you proffer<br />
Your hand to some delicate Dona.<br />
<br />
"Not alone is the voice of my pleading,<br />
But an angel in Heaven <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'comfronts'">confronts</ins> you;<br />
The white wings of sweet Catalina,<br />
Shall flutter the breath of your wooing:<br />
You sent her too early to Heaven<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>To quiet the shade of her anguish.<br />
Two wives&mdash;one on earth, one in Heaven&mdash;<br />
Throw their <i>love</i> and <i>your</i> pride in the balance;<br />
And another whose innocent glances<br />
Should burn all the dross from your nature,<br />
Your child is a witness against you;<br />
God has sent him a pledge of my wifehood,<br />
To nail the black lie of denying.<br />
<br />
"Though no priest gave the mystical signet,<br />
Surely God heard the vows that were spoken<br />
When our hearts took their place at the wedding;<br />
And who shall say nay to a union,<br />
When Love gives our souls to each other?<br />
God is Love, and no higher can speak it.<br />
O, Hernando! be father and husband,<br />
Be angel and saint to Malinche!<br />
She kneels, as she would at God's altar,<br />
To plead for the heart you have broken.<br />
O, turn from your pride, and but touch it,<br />
And it will bloom over with blessing,<br />
And will hallow the hand that shall heal it!"<br />
<br />
All in vain did she plead with the Chieftain;<br />
His pride was the bane of his footsteps.<br />
The angel of Love would have held him,<br />
But the blood of old Spain was too purple,<br />
And smothered her tender endeavor.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>The grip of his purpose still held him,<br />
And Malinche, now passive with anguish,<br />
Was given to Don Xamarillo<br />
With all the sanction of marriage.<br />
He was kind, indulgent and loving,<br />
And she was made wealthy by Cortez<br />
Giving back the estate of her mother<br />
And much of the wealth of the province,<br />
As if he would purchase appeasement.<br />
The Chieftain made lavish atonement,<br />
As far as the world could atone her;<br />
But her heart was impossible healing.<br />
<br />
Though her charities gave her some solace,<br />
And she strove with the earnest of pathos<br />
To lose in the anguish of others<br />
The shadow of self and of sorrow,<br />
Yet she wended her way, broken-hearted;<br />
And, as if like the spirit of Aztlan,<br />
With the mark of perpetual sadness,<br />
With the head bending over and brooding&mdash;<br />
As groping her way to the sunset,<br />
Peering out for the light that was passing<br />
For ever and aye with the shadows&mdash;<br />
She fell asleep with her people,<br />
And an angel was born in Heaven.<br />
<br />
And a guardian angel descended,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>And gathered thy ashes, dead Aztlan!<br />
And spread her white wings o'er the casket,<br />
To wait for the sound of the trumpet<br />
That called thee to life and to freedom.<br />
It rode on the wing of the North Wind,<br />
And shook the whole earth when it sounded.<br />
And no plainer hozanna gave echo,<br />
Than arose from thy halls, Montezuma,<br />
When the shade of Malinche gave battle,<br />
And the armies of Spain were dismembered,<br />
As Mexitli arose from her ashes,<br />
And a star was replanted in Heaven!<br />
<br />
And now, in the dusk of the evening,<br />
When lovers await at the casement,<br />
The tokened response of their ladies,<br />
When Chapultepec garlands her tablets<br />
With the beautiful plumage of springtime,<br />
And a thousand sprays of the sunlight<br />
Give her walls all the charm of enchantment,<br />
Malinche is seen through the shadows,<br />
The unsummoned guest at each wedding;<br />
The unspoken tryst of all lovers;<br />
Wherever two hands are united,<br />
The hand of a third presses o'er them.<br />
The troth of two hearts is cemented<br />
By the one that was cruelly broken.<br />
No symbol of faith can be stronger,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>Than "The love that is true as Malinche's."<br />
<br />
And she watches the fate of the nation<br />
With the jealous eye of a mother,&mdash;<br />
A mother, whose voice more than others<br />
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Tought'">Taught</ins> their lips the first lisp of the Gospel,<br />
And tendered their steps toward Heaven.<br />
A saint, at whose shrine they all gather<br />
When the shadow of war hovers o'er them,<br />
And the eagle swoops down from the mountain<br />
To cover the snake with his talons.<br />
And they pledge anew to the banner<br />
That arose again with the nation,<br />
When the three hundred years of their bondage<br />
Forged their broken links into missiles<br />
To drive Spain into the ocean.<br />
<br />
Thus she holds the warm palm of her people<br />
With a memory stronger than shadow,&mdash;<br />
She lives; and the Spirit of Aztlan,<br />
"The beautiful sphinx of the ages,"<br />
With its foot at the threshold of empire,<br />
And its hand on the pulse of the sunrise,<br />
And its crown of all possible setting,<br />
Has no brighter gem than Malinche.<br />

<h2>THE HARP OF THE WEST.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
Fair Clime of the sunset! more richly endowed<br />
Than Hispan' the knightly, or Gallia the proud&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where the lakes of old Scotia are lost in the maze</span><br />
Of thy thousand that mirror their heavy fringed banks<br />
Of mountain and crag, and the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'statliest'">stateliest</ins> ranks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That ever stood sentinel-watch to the gaze</span><br />
Of a sky bending closer, and breathing more near<br />
Than the heart ever throbbed to the fall of a tear.<br />
<br />
Though the soul be as barren as Gobi's bleak heath<br />
And the spirit of song in the cold throes of death,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Can humanity throttle the play of the breeze</span><br />
O'er the harp that old Nature unwittingly strung,<br />
When the windows of Heaven wide open were flung,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For a thousand years to thy masterful trees?</span><br />
Can the ear fail to hear, or the eye fail to see<br />
Thy rich crown! thy sweet song! great Yo Semite?<br />
<br />
Though the brow of Olympus be crowded with thrones,<br />
And the cliffs of Parnassus resound with the tones<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the Muses that sang at the foot of their god,</span><br />
Not Apollo's great steeds, nor the flame of his car,<br />
Nor Mars, with the terrible glitter of war,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Can dazzle the face of thy sun and thy sod,</span><br />
Bright Star of the West! Thou art Empire's own idol,<br />
The steed of the lightning, untamed to the bridle!<br />
<br />
What is History's wreath but a record of death!<br />
Time breathes on the tablet, it fades with his breath;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But Nature has written in language so strong</span><br />
That Eternity's finger alone can displace,<br />
And write its own letters to fill up the space.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our castles are mountains&mdash;our history, long,&mdash;</span><br />
So long that we simply write God on the page,<br />
And leave other Nations to guess at our age.<br />
<br />
Our song is the present; God fills up the past,<br />
With his rock-written letters; a volume so vast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No hand may transcribe what He leaves as his own.</span><br />
From Sinai we came with his prophet of old,<br />
To the valley where glitters the altar of gold&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall we break, in our frenzy, the tables of stone?</span><br />
No! the letters are fresh, and deep graven the hand.<br />
Far too sacred our charge! As He writ, let them stand!<br />
<br />
When these tablets of Nature shall yield to the brain,<br />
And some bard shall interpret the words they contain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What a song shall burst forth from the prison of thought!</span><br />
As his hand shall pass over the magical strings,<br />
And each chord at his touch into unison springs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As the wing of his impulse is hastily caught,</span><br />
No harp more divine in the turn of the earth<br />
Shall throb to the measures of sorrow and mirth!<br /><br /><br />
